The Functional Requirements Specifications (FRS) report provides the detailed description of the functionalities required for the first version of the CCTNS. The key guiding principle behind the functional design of CCTNS V1.0 is to focus on the critical functionality that provides value to the police personnel at the cutting edge which in turn can improve the outcomes in the areas of “Investigation of Crime” and “Detection of Criminals”. CCTNS  functionality is designed to focus on delivering value to IOs, records room staff and citizens within the broad crime investigation area. Based on the guiding principles stated above, nine different function blocks have been identified and the detailed functionality of each block was determined. 
The functionality of the CCTNS application is focused on providing value to the police personnel, especially the officers operating at the cutting edge and easing the day to day operations of the police function. 
Citizens can register their complaints with police and then based on the evidence, facts and following investigation, police shall take the complaint forward. The Registration module acts as an interface between the police and citizens and it eases the approach, interaction and information exchange between police and complainants. 
After a complaint is initiated, police initiates the investigation process. The Investigation module of the CCTNS facilitates the investigation process and introduces operational efficiencies by automating most of the tasks that take place after initial entries are made during Registration. 
Interfacing with the courts during the prosecution of cases is an integral part of the responsibilities of police personnel. A designated constable from each police station constantly interfaces with the courts. The Prosecution module of the CCTNS aids this interfacing by providing a platform to record entries of the court interactions.  
The Search module of the CCTNS gives police personnel the ability to execute a basic or advanced search on cases. Using the search functionality, police personnel can search for a particular person, type of crime, modus operandi, property etc. It also gives the user the ability to customize the results view by criminal/accused or by cases. It makes reporting easy for police by enabling them to execute different types of queries such as monthly reporting, RTI related etc. 
The Citizen Interface module of the CCTNS acts as a conduit for the information exchange between citizens and police units/personnel. Citizens can use it as a tool to get information or acknowledgements from police. The police in turn can use it to respond to citizens with very little turnaround time. It improves overall productivity by helping citizens and police to cut short the drudgery of large amounts of paperwork. 
The Navigation module of the CCTNS provides role based landing pages which help in navigating through the CCTNS application. It shows information such as cases assigned, alerts, pending tasks etc hence helping police personnel to plan better and execute with greater efficiency.
The Configuration module of the CCTNS helps keep the application configured according to the states’ requirements in addition to keeping data elements/rules up to date. With a proper configuration, information such as act and sections, state specific data, castes, tribes, property information etc. can be created updated and deleted. The functional requirements for each of the modules are provided as A1 to A7 in separate enclosures.
The non-functional requirements specify the qualitative attributes such as user-friendliness and performance of the system that are critical for the increased user-acceptance of the application.
1. The solution should provide detailed context-sensitive help material for all the possible actions and scenarios on all user interfaces in the application. 2. The help should be accessible to the users both in the offline and online mode
1. The solution should provide an interface for the user to log any defects or enhancement requests on the application and track thereafter. 2. The solution should send alerts (e.g., email, SMS) to the user if the user chooses to whenever any action has been taken on the alert 3. The solution should enable the user to track the submitted defect or enhancement request. 4. The solution should enable the help-desk user to view the reports on the submitted defects or enhancement requests category-wise, status-wise, and agewise. 
5. The support solution should be accessible to the users both from within the application and also outside the application through a browser interface. 
1. An audit trail is a record of actions taken by either the user or the system triggers. This includes actions taken by users or Administrators, or actions initiated automatically by the system as a result of system parameters. The System must keep an unalterable audit trail capable of automatically capturing and storing information about: • All the actions (create/read/update/delete) that are taken upon the critical entities (case, suspect, property,…) in the system • The user initiating and or carrying out the action; • The date and time of the event. • Administrative parameters The word “unalterable” is to mean that the audit trail data cannot be modified in any way or deleted by any user; it may be subject to re-department and copying to removable media if required, so long as its contents remain unchanged. 2. Once the audit trail functionality has been activated, the System must track events without manual intervention, and store in the audit trail information about them. 3. The System must maintain the audit trail for as long as required, which will be at least for the life of the case to which it refers. 4. The System must ensure that audit trail data is available for inspection on request, so that a specific event can be identified and all related data made accessible, and that this can be achieved by authorized external personnel who have little or no familiarity with the system. 5. The System must be able to export audit trails for specified cases (without affecting the audit trail stored by the System). This functionality can be used by external auditors who wish to examine or analyze system activity. 6. The System must be able to capture and store violations (i.e. A user’s attempts to access a case to which he is denied access), and (where violations can validly be attempted) attempted violations, of access control mechanisms. 7. The System must at a minimum be able to provide reports for actions on cases organised: • By case; • By user; • In chronological sequence. 
8. The System should be able to provide reports for actions on cases organised by workstation and (where technically appropriate) by network address. The requirements specify the requirements to control the user access to correspondences, files, and records and various functionalities provided within the system. 
1. The System must allow the user to limit access to cases to specified users or user groups. 2. The system should provide for role-based control for the functionality within the system. 3. The System must allow a user to be a member of more than one group. 4. The System must allow only admin-users to set up user profiles and allocate users to groups. 5. The System should allow a user to stipulate which other users or groups can access cases. 6. The System must allow changes to security attributes for groups or users (such as access rights, security level, privileges, password allocation and management) to be made only by super-user. 7. If a user requests access to, or searches for, a case which he does not have the right to access, the System must provide one of the following responses (selectable at configuration time): • display title and metadata; • display the existence of a case but not its title or other metadata; • do not display any case information or indicate its existence in any way. These options are presented in order of increasing security. Note that the requirement in the third option (i.e. the most stringent) implies that the System must not include such cases in any count of search results; this level of security is normally appropriate for cases dealing with matters such as national security. 8. If a user performs a quick or advanced search, the System must never include in the search result list any record which the user does not have the right to access. 9. If the System allows users to make unauthorised attempts to access cases, it must log these in the audit trail. 10. Any access to cases, and all other activities involving the cases and related documents or data should also need to be stored in the audit trail to ensure legal admissibility and to assist in data recovery. 
1. All error messages produced by the System must be meaningful, so that they can be appropriately acted upon by the users who are likely to see them. Ideally, each error message will be accompanied by explanatory text and an indication of the action(s) which the user can take in response to the error. 2. The System must employ a single set of user interface rules, or a small number of sets to provide a familiar and common look and feel for the application. 
3. The System must be able to display several entities (cases, suspects) simultaneously. 4. The interfaces must be made customizable or user-configurable to the extent possible. (e.g., the displayed columns in the table, move, resize, modify the appearance). Such configurations must be saved in the user profile. 5. The System user interface must be suitable for users with special needs; that is, compatible with specialist software that may be used and with appropriate interface guidelines 6. The System must provide End User and Administrator functions which are easy to use and intuitive throughout. 7. The System must allow persistent defaults for data entry where desirable. These defaults should include: • user-definable values; • values same as previous item; • values derived from context, e.g. date, file reference, user identifier; 8. Frequently-executed System transactions must be designed so that they can be completed with a small number of interactions (e.g. mouse clicks). 9. Where the System employs a graphical user interface, it must allow users to customise it. Customisation should include, but need not be limited to the following changes: • menu contents; • layout of screens; • use of function keys; • on-screen colours, fonts and font sizes; 
1. The user interfaces should be designed to make them user-intuitive. 2. The user interfaces of the system should comply with Standard ISO 9241. 3. ICT accessibility: ISO 9241-20 shall be the standard for guidance on ICT accessibility. Application user interfaces to meet its requirements and recommendations. Software accessibility ISO 9241-171 shall be the standard for guidance on software accessibility. User interfaces should meet its requirements and recommendations. Content accessibility WCAG 1.0 shall be the standard used for guidance on content accessibility. The application logo to be available on all pages as a link to the home page.
4. Providing text equivalents for non-text media objects: All non-text media objects, such as graphical images or video, should be provided with alternative equivalent textual descriptions and/or with equivalent text-based functionality. 5. Making navigation self-descriptive: Navigation should be designed to help users understand where they are, where they have been and where they can go next. General guidance on achieving self-descriptiveness is given in ISO 9241-110. 6. Showing users where they are: Each presentation segment (page or window) should provide the user with a clear and sufficient indication of where he or she is in the navigation structure and of the current segment position with respect to the overall structure. 7. Offering alternative access paths: Alternative access paths for navigating to a specific unit of content should be offered to support different navigation strategies. 8. Minimizing navigation effort: The number of navigation steps needed to reach a certain piece of content should be minimized as long as different mental models, navigation strategies and tasks of the user are taken into account. 9. Splash screens should be avoided unless they provide useful content or feedback about the application state to the user. If a splash screen is used, a navigation option to skip it should be offered. 10. Avoiding opening unnecessary windows: Additional windows such as new browser windows or pop-up windows should only be opened if this supports the user’s task. Opening new windows can distract, confuse or impede users for a variety of reasons. They can superimpose the primary window, hiding relevant information. They could make it cognitively more difficult to understand the navigation structure with negative effects on both usability and accessibility. They also require additional user actions for closing unwanted windows.
11. Vertical scrolling should be minimized. This may be done by placing important information at the top and providing links to information that is further down the page. Horizontal scrolling should be avoided wherever possible. 12. Designing for input device independence: User interfaces should be designed to allow activation of controls by a variety of input devices. The ability to choose between different input devices for activating controls such as links, fields and buttons is important both for users who prefer a certain input mode, mobile users and users with disabilities. In general, device independence can be achieved if the functionality is operable via a keyboard. 13. Making user interfaces robust: User interfaces should be designed to be as robust as possible in the face of changing technology. This encompasses being able to present content containing newer technologies by older user agents as well as designing content to be usable with future technologies. 14. Acceptable opening / download times: Application pages should be designed and implemented so that there are acceptable opening times and download times for the expected range of technical contexts of use (e.g. bandwidth between the application and the user). This is particularly important for frequently accessed pages or pages that are important for user navigation and exploration, such as the home page. 15. Minimizing user errors: Potential user errors as well as the effort needed to recover from errors should be minimized. 16. Providing clear error messages: The content of error messages shown on the pages or special error pages should clearly state the reason why the error occurred and, if possible, actions the user can take to resolve the error. Users expect error messages to be in the same language as the user interface. 17. Using appropriate formats, units of measurement or currency: When designing user interfaces for use by diverse groups, input and output of information elements such as currency, units of measurement, temperatures, date and time, phone numbers, address or postal codes should be designed so that they are usable. 18. Making text resizable by the user: Text should be able to be resized by the user, using functions provided by the user agent or other appropriate means i.e. see ISO 9241-171. 19. Text quality: The quality of textual content with respect to spelling and grammar should be sufficient so as not to impede readability. 20. Writing style: The reading and understanding of the textual content on the screen should be supported by suitable means, including the use of short sentences, the division of the text into shorter chunks or the presentation of content items in the form of bullet points.  
21. Supporting text skimming: Fast skimming of text should be supported by the provision of clear links, bulleted lists, highlighted keywords, logical headings, and short phrases and sentences. 22. Readability of text: Text presented on the pages should be readable taking into account the expected display characteristics and spatial arrangement. ISO 9241-303 shall be consulted for screen text legibility requirements. 23. Distinguishable within-page links: Within-page links should be clearly distinguishable from other links that lead to a different page. EX. Within-page links are shown with dashed rather than solid underlines 24. Avoiding link overload: Text pages containing large proportions of links should be formatted so that the presence of links does not impede the readability of the text. 25. Using familiar terminology for navigation links: Navigation links — particularly links representing the main navigation structure — should be labelled with terms that are familiar to the user, based on his/her general knowledge, prior experience in the application domain or experience of using other systems. 26. Using descriptive link labels: The target or purpose of a link should be directly indicated by its label, avoiding generic labels such as “go” or “click here” except where the purpose of the link is clear from its context on the page or the labels have commonly understood semantics in the particular application domain. Using appropriate terminology specific to the user’s tasks and information needs is important for making the content easy to understand. 27. Marking links opening new windows: Links that open new browser windows or pop-up windows should be clearly marked. 28. Distinguishing navigation links from controls: Navigation links should be clearly distinguishable from controls activating some action. Typical action types in user interfaces include manipulating application data, performing searches, communication actions, such as opening a new e-mail window or starting a chat function, and Hpresentation-related actions, such as sorting a list of search results. 29. Providing printable document versions: If a document is either too long, dispersed over several pages or in a specific layout that is not suitable for online reading, a printer-friendly version of the document should be provided that prints the content in a form acceptable to the user (e.g. in the expected layout, paper format, or orientation).
30. Use of “white space”: “White space” on a page i.e. space filled only with the background color should be used in such a way that it does not impair the visual skimming of the page. While white space is an important means of visually organizing the different content elements on a page, if the distance between the blocks of information displayed becomes too large, rapid skimming of the page can be impeded. 31. Selecting appropriate page lengths The length of a page should be selected so as to support the primary purpose and use of the page. Short pages are generally more appropriate for homepages, navigation pages, or overview pages that need to be read quickly. Longer pages can be more appropriate when users want to read the content without interruptions or when the page needs to match a paper counterpart. 32. Using colour: Colour should be used with care, taking into account human capabilities and restrictions in perceiving colour, and not as the only means of conveying information. Color should never be the only means of coding. Some users may have difficulties in perceiving certain colors or color combinations (color-blindness). 33. Using frames with care: If frames are used, care should be taken to avoid possible problems, for example, those involving the use of the back button, bookmarking of pages, or scrolling of information. When frames are used, it is important to title each frame, and to describe its purpose and how frames relate to one another other. 34. Providing alternatives to frame-based presentation: If frames are used, an alternative way of presenting relevant information without frames should be provided. Providing alternative text-only pages: When style sheets and/or frames are turned off it should be possible for the user to read and understand the page; alternatively, the user should be provided with an equivalent alternative text-only page. 35. Consistent page layout: Pages should be designed using consistent layout schemes, supporting the user in finding similar information at the same position on different pages. Overall layout schemes apply to all pages and are preferable when all pages have a similar structure. Frequently, however, different pages have different purposes and types of content. In such cases, pages can usually be grouped in different categories, using one layout scheme for each category consistently. 36. Placing title information consistently: Page titles should be placed in a consistent location on the different pages. 37. Observing principles of human perception When designing application pages, the general principles of human perception should be taken into account. The International Standards mentioned below shall be consulted for guidance. Practical guidelines for presenting information to the user are to be found in ISO 9241-12. Guidance on selecting and using different forms of interaction techniques is to be found in ISO 9241-14 to ISO 9241-17. ISO 9241-14 gives guidance about menus, ISO 9241-15 about command dialogues, ISO 9241-16 about direct manipulation and ISO 9241-17 about forms. In addition, when designing multimedia information presentations, the design principles and recommendations described in ISO 14915-1 to ISO 14915-3 should be taken into account. Appropriate content presentation also plays a key role in accessibility. 38. Linking back to the home page or landmark pages: Each page should contain a link leading to the home page of the application or to a landmark page that is easy to recognize for the user. 39. Providing a site map: A separate navigation overview such as a site map should be provided for application showing the structure of the site in an overview form. 40. Consistency between navigation components and content: If navigation components (or overviews) are shown in conjunction with associated content, consistency between the navigation component and the content shown should be maintained by indicating in the navigation component (e.g. highlighting) the topic currently visible in the content area. 41. Placing navigation components consistently: Navigation components should be placed consistently on the pages or in the framesets in the pages of the application. 42. Individualization and user adaptation : Adapting the content and the navigation of a user interface to individual users or user groups can be a useful mechanism for providing information that is of interest to the users and for making access to relevant information more efficient. User adaptation can also be important for making the user interface more accessible. Different approaches can be used for achieving these goals, like providing users with means for customizing the user interface to their personal needs i.e. individualization designing content and navigation differently for varying user groups or roles i.e. such as employees of different levels, citizens etc, monitoring the user’s behaviour and adapting to the user’s goals that are inferred from the behaviour observed, recommending information that is potentially more relevant or interesting to the specific user, based on the behaviour of all users or a user group. 43. Taking account of the users’ tasks and information needs: When providing different access paths or navigation structures for different user groups, the tasks and information needs of these user groups should be taken into consideration. 44. Making individualization and adaptation evident: It should be made evident to the user when individualization and/or adaptation are used. 45. Making user profiles evident: If predefined user profiles or user-specified profiles are used for individualizing or adapting content, the profile currently used should be made evident. If profiles are used, it is important to provide users with information about this concept and its implications. 46. Allowing users to see and change profiles: If user-specified profiles are used, users should be able to see, modify and delete that profile on demand. 47. The user interfaces of the system should follow the guidelines specified under www.usability.gov 1. The System must be available to users 2. The planned downtime for the System must not exceed hours per . The System is considered to be down if any user is unable to perform any normal System function and if this failure is attributed to any component of the System other than the workstation. 3. Unplanned downtime for the System must not exceed per . 4. The number of incidents of unplanned downtime for the System must not exceed per . 5. In the event of any software or hardware failure, it must be possible to restore the System (with inline synchronization) within no more than hours. 1. The System must provide adequate response times for commonly performed functions under both standard and peak conditions 2. The System must be able to perform a simple search within 5-8 seconds and a advanced search (multiple search criteria) within 10-15 seconds regardless of the storage capacity or number of cases in the system. In this context, performing a search means returning a result list. It does not include retrieving the records themselves. 3. The System must be able to retrieve and display within 5-8 seconds the case which has been accessed within the previous 2 months, regardless of storage capacity or number of cases in the system. This requirement is intended to allow for rapid retrieval of frequently-used cases, on the understanding that frequency of use is typically correlated with recent use. 4. The System must be able to retrieve and display within 20 seconds the case which has not been accessed within the previous 2 months, regardless of storage capacity or number of cases in the system. This requirement is intended to allow for cases where cases used infrequently are stored on slower media than more active records. 5. The System be scaleable and must not have any features which would preclude use in small or large police stations, with varying numbers of cases handled. 
The proposed functional architecture is modeled around centralized deployment to facilitate ease of maintenance and leverage advancement in open standards and web technologies. The 3 C’s (Core-Configuration-Customization) forms the guiding principle for the architecture. The functional architecture of the CCTNS solution is given in the figure below. The functional architecture is composed of 4 major components based on SOA principles. Each of the components contains multiple services as defined by Service Definition. The core services, support layer and security and access control components can be deployed as standard components with necessary configuration changes. The customization layer can override and add to the core services based on the specific state requirements and can be plugged with the core services. 
The deployment of the application will be at state level and will be configured and customized as per the state specific extensions. The systems should be designed with the following broad guidelines: System Functionality 1) The system should support multilingual interface 2) The system should be designed in manner that operational data is not lost in case of any failure of equipment or communication network. 3) The system should work even in an offline mode with the critical functionality 4) The system should be designed to have satisfactory performance even in Police Stations connected on low-bandwidth 5) The system should be implemented using Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) and have a modular design 6) The system should be developed on Open Standards 7) The system should be built on a common User Access and Authentication Service to ensure Single-Sign on for the end-user 8) The system should be developed for a centralized deployment and maintenance 9) The system should be developed to be deployed in a 3-tier datacenter architecture 10) The system should be designed to have a n-tier architecture with the presentation logic separated from the business logic that is again separated from the data-access logic 11) The system should be extensible to provide access to the interfaces through PDA’s and mobile data terminals 
12) The system should adopt standardized formats and common metadata elements 13) The system should be designed for access through browser-based systems and must impose minimal requirements on the client device 14) The system must support multiple types of communication services for remote access 15) The system should have capability to support public access to a subset of data and functionality 16) The system should support multi-tier authentication where required 
17) The system should support SSL encrypted connections 18) The system should support secure virtual private network connections 19) The system should use HTTPS as the communication protocol, i.e., HTTP over an encrypted secure socket layer (SSL) 20) The system should run on multiple browsers 21) The system should support selective encryption of the stored data 22) The system should ensure secure transmission of data over the network and utilize SSL and 2-way digital signatures 23) The system should ensure high standards of security and access control through: a) Prevent cross-site scripting b) Validate the incoming data / user request c) Encode the incoming data / user request d) Prevent SQL Injection e) Utilize parameterized queries f) Sanitize the user-inputs g) Validate the data both at the client and server h) Do not allow hard delete and perform only soft tagging the row for deletion  
The system should ensure high scalability and performance through: a) Use of cache for storing frequent data b) Use of AJAX based technology to improve user experience. Aggressive page loading to be considered based on the screen and estimate usage pattern c) Leverage Asynchronous HTTP socket capabilities of web server for scalability and performance d) Host all the static content (documents, images) on the web server e) The search results should be fetched from the database in batches of 10 or 20 maximum as configured within the application f) Display of records on the screen in batches/paged manner g) The search should fetch only the fields that need to be displayed to the user. Only when the user clicks on a particular record to view its further details should a query be fired to fetch the additional details for this particular record only h) A hierarchical cache should be configured and used for caching of results of most frequently used searches i) Database Indexes should be applied on the key columns used for searching

The document defines the operational requirements for Gemini Control System software. The goal of the SRS is to provide a functional tool for guiding the development of controls and data acquisition systems in a manner consistent with their operation within the Gemini System. It establishes both general criteria and specific functional requirements for soft- ware and controls design in the Gemini Project.
 


	

	

	

	

It is oriented toward the developers of control and data acquisition systems, not toward the science user of the Gemini telescopes. As such, it logically follows the Operational Con- cepts document, which addresses the control of the Gemini system from a more general perspective. The impacts of the science requirements, as well as requirements of control system design are covered in this document.
 


 
Gemini software is all software directly involved in the control of Gemini systems, including commercial packages used for that purpose. However, only the non-com- mercial portions of this soft ware are addressed in detail here, along with the inter- faces to those commercial packages.
 
If this document is viewed as presenting a set of standards for software development, then the software used with the Gemini telescopes can be viewed as falling into the following categories:
A.
Developed software - non-commercial software developed for the control of the telescopes and instrumentation. This software falls under the specifications presented here and this document can be viewed as a guide to developing that software.
B.
Supported software - commercial or “public-domain” software used for telescope control and instrumentation. One of the design goals for Gemini software is to use as much off-the-shelf software as possible, in an effort to decrease life-cycle costs and maintenance concerns. However, the nature of this software makes it difficult to force into the specifications here. Consequently, this document presents the interface speci- fications required of such software and encourages potential adopters of this software to evaluate it in terms of the specifications presented here.
C.External software - any software available to the Gemini system that is not integral to the system. User-supplied data reduction tools, operating systems, CASE tools, etc. are generally considered external software. Only the interface requirements to such software is considered part of the Gemini software.
Software that is embedded into hardware and that presents no software interface to the Gemini system is also considered external software and need not be considered further. Embedded software that does interface with the Gemini system via software is considered Gemini software and is subject to the requirements presented in this document.
 
All software will be maintained under a version control system, and must include facilities for easy (nearly automatic) inclusion into the Gemini software environment.




	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	The users of the Gemini system are classified into the following categories.
A. Astronomer. This person is using the Gemini system for the collection of science data. In a very real sense, the astronomer is the customer for the services provided by the Gemini telescopes. The astronomer has worked out, with the Gemini system, a science plan for the collection of the data. This science plan may include interactive observing.
B. Science observer. This is the on-site person responsible for monitoring the data acquisi- tion and validating the data integrity being collected for the astronomer, as well as ensur- ing that the science plan is functioning to the needs of the astronomer.
C. Telescope Operator. The on-site controller of the telescope and instruments. This person is responsible for ensuring the integrity of the system and for keeping the system function- ing accurately during observations. The Telescope Operator works with the Observer and the science plan to produce as good data as is possible.
D. Support. On-site (or near-site) support personnel are responsible for the maintenance of the system, hardware and software, as well as the installation of subsystems and configu- ration changes.
E. Developer. Developers are responsible for the designing, testing, configuring, and upgrading of subsystems.
 
  
 
OPERATIONAL LEVELS
 
F.
Administrator. Administrators are responsible for high-level functional control of the Gemini system as an integrated system. They work with other users to determine appropriate observation scheduling changes, maintenance down-time, and system modifications. It is possible that a particular individual would fall into several of the categories. For example, it is not unusual for the astronomer to also be the science observer.


	

	

	

	

The Gemini system, when powered on, exists in one of several disjoint operational levels. Access to the system is restricted according to the current level of operation.
 
The operational levels are:
A.
Observing level. The observing level is the “normal” operational mode of the sys- tem.
B.
Maintenance level. Maintenance level permits access to all subsystems for routine maintenance and diagnostic work. The telescope is typically at maintenance level during daylight (non-observing) hours.
C.
Test level. The most primitive operational level, test level operation is used for installation/deinstallation of subsystems, including full diagnostics and installation calibration activities.


	

	

	

	

At any level, but particularly during observing level operation, the software imposes on the Gemini system a series of access modes. These access modes balance ease and convenience of use against flexibility, control, and the security of the system.
 
The access modes provided by the Gemini system are:
A.
Observing. This mode provides simple and safe access to the system for the collec- tion of science data, selection of instrument parameters, and quick-look data reduc- tion. Access to the system is through the sequencer with no direct control of telescope and instruments
B.
Monitoring. This is a special, read-only case of the observing mode that can be invoked on a subsystem basis. Under no circumstances should monitoring affect the performance of an ongoing observation.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 


	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

C. Operation. This is the access used for direct control of the telescope and instruments, typically during observation level operation. It is normally available only to the Telescope Operator and the science program sequencer when at operation level.
D. Planning. Access to the Gemini system is provided during science planning. Actual access to the telescope is not permitted in this mode, but the virtual telescope capability of the Gemini system provides a telescope simulator that is useful for planning observations, as are on-line databases.
E. Testing. Test access allows full, direct control of any subsystem. All features of the sub- system are available in this mode. Under no circumstances should testing affect the per- formance of an ongoing observation.
F. Administrative. It is possible to inquire about system utilization, efficiency, etc. using administrative access. No control is available in this mode, only status and scheduling information is accessible. Under no circumstances should administrative access affect the performance of an ongoing observation.
 
It is entirely possible for a single user to be accessing the system through several modes simultaneously. In fact, this is the typical situation with the Telescope Operator, who is often concurrently accessing the system through the observer, monitor, and operator modes. There are times when an astronomer might be using both observer and monitor modes.


	

	

	

	

Users of the system will be located at one or more facilities. These are referred to in gen- eral as Gemini 8m Telescopes operations facilities. The Gemini 8m Telescopes enclosure and Gemini 8m Telescopes control facility are referred to collectively as the Gemini 8m Telescopes site.

These are super sites, in general located in partner countries, which have direct links to the telescopes via communications lines. They may or may not be collocated with any administrative organization associated with the Gemini telescopes. These sites have remote operations capability.
 


	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

These are sites with high bandwidth connections to the super sites. They have remote operations capability but at a reduced level.
 
Will these high bandwidth connections be private or public, or doesn’t it matter? I don’t understand the different between a remote operations facility and a satellite site. Why does the satellite site not just connect directly to the telescope? — Steven.
 


	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

These are sites, generally located at existing observatories, universities, etc. that have some form of connectivity, perhaps via satellite sites and/or super sites, to the tele- scopes. Although they have remote operations capability, the link capacity will deter- mine at what level.
 
Does this statement mean that the Gemini system has to support remote operations at a level which depends on the remote site’s capability?

Unless the contrary is explicitly stated, all requirements and modes presented are intended to be available to all users of the system.
 
It should also be noted that what the system has to guarantee in terms of operations must fulfill all possible requirements, but it does not mean that all features will be made available to all users at all locations at all times.
 
The available capabilities will have to be adapted to the operational needs both locally and remotely and these decisions can only be taken later in the life of the project.

Observing astronomers are the end users of the system. They range greatly in experi- ence from occasional users of the system to very experienced users such as staff astronomers at the Gemini 8m Telescopes site and service observers.

Whatever their level of experience, observing astronomers will wish to concentrate on the efficient acquisition of astronomical data and on-line assessment of data qual- ity, rather than on the details of controlling the telescope and instruments.
To allow observing astronomers to achieve this objective, the system must offer to a user an interface which, while fulfilling the various operational requirements in the different modes and offering status information both automatically and on request at any required level, is still simple to learn and secure in its use.

USER-LEVEL REQUIREMENTS
Observing astronomers shall have no privileges as far as the direct control of the telescope is concerned. They shall not be able to send control commands directly but they must be able to enquire about the status of the telescope or any subsystem at any time. The intent is not to restrict the capabilities of the observing astronomer in any way but rather to estab- lish a single point of control and responsibility. Programs, as opposed to observers, may have the capability of direct control of the telescope. This would allow the observer to cre- ate an observing program which requested a telescope control function but would not allow the observer to enter (for instance) a command to slew the mount. Astronomers are typically given control access to instruments, however.
•
Operation mode
Traditional interactive operation shall normally be replaced by operation via an automatic sequencer. This is essential to support operational requirements such as service observing and flexible scheduling (as defined later in Section 2.7 on page 2-12).
A certain degree of interaction shall be provided, meaning in this case that the user will interact with the scheduler program, rather than with the control programs directly.
Observing commands will normally be submitted via the User interface to a queue for later execution. It must also be possible to break and resequence this queue. e.g. as a result of the quality assessment of previous data.
In particular, Operations staff will be able to enable direct interactive operation, but this shall not be considered as the normal operation mode for the reasons explained in Section 2.7 on page 2-12. It is evident that, for some functions (such as adjustment of spectrograph slit width for seeing conditions) it must be necessary to include interactive capability. However each instance of such a function should be examined as a candidate for automation - such as focussing.
The existence of the scheduling queue shall be transparent to the on-site observer during the initial phases of telescope operation. Only after experience has been gained with the system will the existence of the queue become evident to the on site observer.


	

	

	

	

• Definition
Currently, operations staff includes 'night assistants' and staff of the 'operations group'. Depending on the operations implemented on the Gemini 8m Telescopes, they may become telescope operators, operations supervisors of the Gemini 8m Telescopes tele- scope, and instrument operators and have to overview the Gemini 8m Telescopes opera- tion.
These users will be very experienced users of the system. They will be very familiar with the Gemini 8m Telescopes and/or its instruments.

USER-LEVEL REQUIREMENTS
Operations staff will control the Gemini 8m Telescopes indirectly via a scheduler program or directly via commands. They will supervise telescope operation and will be able to advise observing astronomers on what they have to do to use telescope and instruments efficiently. They shall also monitor general performance and system safety.
• Privileges
Operations staff shall have privileges to access all commands and maintenance pro- cedures in case of problems. This includes direct control of physical units.
However, they shall not have access to subsystems while these are in normal opera- tion. If they need to access other parts of the system appropriate reconfiguration pro- cedures have to be run.
• Operation mode
Operations staff shall have access to operation tables in update mode, while observ- ing astronomers will have access to them only in read mode (for example the list of filters mounted on an instrument). Again, the intent is not to restrict the capabilities of the observing astronomer in any way but rather to establish a single point of control and responsibility. At the present time it is not clear how to handle visitor instrument requirements in this area.
 
They shall be able to change the operational status of units according to the results of tests performed on such units (e.g. to see if a faulty unit can be declared as opera- tional again and redefined as part of the environment in use).


	

	

	

	

• Definition
Software development and maintenance are staff:
•
based either at the Gemini 8m Telescopes site or base facility, or
• based at the Gemini 8m Telescopes remote operations facility, or
• non Gemini staff from a contract company or from an associated Institute. These users will have a deep understanding of the way the Gemini 8m Telescopes software works.
• Purpose of work;
Software development and maintenance staff intervene when there is a major prob- lem to be solved or an upgrade to be installed. They also perform system generation and installation of new software packages or new releases, according to established test and validation procedures.

OPERATIONAL CONTEXT
Software development and maintenance staff need the highest privilege in order to be able to modify everything in the system. Nevertheless strict configuration control guidelines must be followed to prevent interference with ongoing normal operation.
• Operation mode
Software development and maintenance staff usually work at the test level (see Section 3.2.1.3 on page 3-4) for the part of the software under test. Other parts of the
Gemini 8m Telescopes may also need to run in test mode to support integration tests. This means that a number of commands are available which allow the hardware concerned to be tested (test commands) and are not accessible to observing astronomers.


	

	

	

	

This section derives directly from Gemini 8m Telescopes program requirements and spec- ifies the operational context, which is a direct consequence of the structure of the Gemini 8m Telescopes system.
 
The Gemini 8m Telescopes operation has to cope with a complex environment produced by:
• multi-telescope concept
• multi-instrument context
• visitor instrument context
• multi-user context.
 


	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

Although there are two telescopes as part of the Gemini system there are no plans to sup- port concurrent use of them as if they were a single facility. It is, however, a long term goal of the Gemini project to be capable of being used in conjunction with nearby, perhaps non-Gemini, telescopes on the same site (for instance for interferometry).
 


	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

Normally three scientific instruments are mounted on the cassegrain focus of the tele- scope. The Gemini 8m Telescopes are thus characterized all the time as in a multi-instru- ment context.
 
Parallel access to all the mounted instruments shall be provided, though only one instru- ment has access to the telescope beam (active instrument).
 
 
 
 
 


	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	



 
 
 


	

	

	

	

OPERATIONAL CONTEXT
Instruments which feed two detectors by using beam splitters or field splitters is con- sidered as a single active instrument. Feeding two separate instruments via beam splitters or field splitters and providing separate control nodes is not a requirement.
 
Various situations are possible for the other (inactive) instruments:
• they shall be able to take calibration or flat field exposures in parallel
• they shall be able to prepare for an exposure to start as soon as the telescope beam is switched back to them (in this case, they are in a hot standby situation)
• they shall be able to work; at all foreseen operation levels (observing, maintenance, test) (see Section 3.2.1 on page 3-3).
 
Regardless of the status of an inactive instrument, it shall not be possible for any of its permitted actions to adversely impact the active instrument.
 


	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

The requirement to provide for support, installation, and operation of outside instru- ments brought by the observer has several implications for the system. Due to the specialized nature of visitor instrumentation it is unlikely that complete integration into the Gemini environment is either feasible or warranted. In this case a subset of the available functionality must be made available through a standardized interface. The Gemini Telescopes view all instruments as operating as servers, responding to commands from the upper levels of the system. Visitor instruments must be capable of operating in this mode to be adequately supported.
 
It should be the goal of this interface that it be a subset of the existing instrumentation interface (rather than a separate system). At a minimum this interface should support:
•
acquisition of status information of instrument by other systems
• capability to enter preprogrammed observing sequences
• capability to offset the telescope position and focus
 
It should be a goal, but not a requirement, that the interface provide support for
• coordinate transforms between visitor instrument and the Gemini system
• archiving (or archivibility) of visitor instrument data
• maintenance of operations tables (such as filter lists) which can become part of an observation's permanent record
 
 
 
 
 


	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	



 
 
 


	

	

	

	

OPERATIONAL CONTEXT
Due to the nature of visitor instrumentation it is unlikely that more complicated function- ality can be supported. In particular coordinated motions of the Gemini system compo- nents with those of the visitor instrument (other than simple raster scans) will not be supported.
 
This does not mean that more complicated functionality will not be possible for visitor instruments that require it. Such functionality will not be offered as a standard service but will require a joint effort on the part of Gemini and the visitor instrument team. As more complicated functionality will be supported via standardized interfaces for the Gemini instruments, such as coordinated motions, it should be possible to adapt visitor instru- ments to this standard. The difficulty with offering such services as an externally sup- ported standard, as opposed to an internally supported standard, is that decisions to change internal standards do not impact external users.
 
It is important that the visitor instrument interface be stable and long-lived, as the time between successive uses of the same visitor instrument can be as long as one or two years.
 
The support of visitor instrumentation is made simpler if the visitor equipment adheres to the Gemini standards. However it must be recognized that:
• the Gemini standards may not prove cost effective for some visitor instruments
• the Gemini standards will evolve over time as requirements and technology change
• the evolution of Gemini standards might require existing visitor instruments to rewrite or rework large areas of their control system
• visitor instruments built later in time than the initial complement of Gemini instruments may want to take advantage of different and/or less expensive technology if it better suits the goals of their project
 
For these reasons it is probably not possible to establish a combined standard to which all instruments, both Gemini and visitor, adhere to completely. It is much better to establish a subset of Gemini facilities which will be made available to visitor instruments via long lived, stable interfaces. Visitor requirements outside of these would be handled on an as needed basis.
 
The support of both Gemini and visitor instruments would benefit by the provision of a Gemini observatory simulator. This simulator, appearing to the instrument as a standard set of hardware and software interfaces, would present a functional definition of the obser- vatory.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 


	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	



 
 
 


	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

OBSERVING MODE REQUIREMENTS
 
The requirements to have instruments operated as single units imply that several user stations will be active at the same time on the Gemini 8m Telescopes. On these user stations, different kinds of users may be working at the same time with the Gemini 8m Telescopes software.
 
Independently of the location of users at the telescope site, they shall be able to access (according to their privileges) any part of the whole setup with a simple logon and configuration operation. In other words. any subsection of the whole Gemini 8m Telescopes system should be accessible and controllable from any single point (but of course with protection ensuring security and safety).
 
A particularly simple case of multi-use of the system is multi-point monitoring. By this it is meant that, while some (active) user is in control of the Gemini 8m Tele- scopes, someone else can follow what they are doing by monitoring all the relevant data from telescope and instruments. This will typically be needed by the operation supervisor. All other users wishing to monitor Gemini 8m Telescopes operations have to go through the procedures set up by Operations and get permission to do so.
 
The multi-point monitoring mode might also be important when certain difficult or rare problems occur, when expert advice is needed and can only be obtained from colleagues situated remotely. Multi-point monitoring allows them to follow directly the results of tests performed and investigate how the system is working (e.g. by selecting different display pages with the up-to-date status information on different parts of the system).
 
Multi-point monitoring also allows a local observer to be monitored and advised by a remote supervisor.
 
Monitoring shall exist both in the form of automatic displays of status information at different locations, and in the form of explicit access to the required status informa- tion from any point.
 
Monitoring shall not affect the performance of ongoing observations.


	

	

	

	

The different observing modes (interactive, queue-based, remote-operations and ser- vice) impose constraints on software design.
 
 
 
 
 


	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	



 
 
 


	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

OBSERVING MODE REQUIREMENTS
 
Requirements:
A. Normally executed with the sequencer by providing a computer executable program, in order to make efficient use of the Gemini telescope.
B.
Interactive operation is supported, but always through the Observatory Control System (OCS).
C. There is a visual user interface to the OCS to allow for changes to the viewing program.
D. It is possible to have more than one station participate in the observing.
 
Interactive observing with time allocation for full nights is a first basic requirement of the Gemini 8m Telescopes. It is therefore an essential requirement that telescope operation is supported by the software in a smooth and very friendly way in this mode.
 
Interaction will normally be via an automatic sequencer (see Section 2.5.9 on page 2-6). This is clearly a top priority requirement and one which will have to be realized before implementing any other mode. The initial implementation of the automatic sequencer will operate in a “pass through” mode where all commands are accepted and transmitted with minimal checking and delay.
 


	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

Queue-based observing is the primary observation mode used with the Gemini telescopes, as it is the best means of providing sound science data while maximizing efficient use of the telescope. While its requirements include all those given below for service observing, it has the following special requirements.
A.
The observing program must be fully automated, requiring very little human interaction during the observation. The means that the Gemini software must include a sufficiently rich programming environment to make this feasible. In addition, this should be a visu- ally-oriented environment providing a simple, easy-to-use interface to the astronomer.
B.
There should be a full telescope simulator to enable the astronomer to test observing pro- grams for completeness, errors, and functionality. This simulator should function within the virtual telescope environment of the Gemini system.
C.
All control software must provide support for simulated use within the virtual telescope.
D. There is a requirement for software to assist in object selection both within an observing program and across observing programs, in order to optimize observing efficiency. This software must consider target positions, weather conditions, and instrument configura- tions.
 
 
 
 


	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	



 
 
 


	

	

	

	

OBSERVING MODE REQUIREMENTS
E. There must be software to support the flexible scheduling, both manually and via a scheduler, allowing for the interleaving of observing programs in a manner that is transparent to the individual observing programs. This includes managing the collec- tion of science, environmental, engineering, reference, and calibration data.
F.
To maximize the use of the available observing time it must be possible to queue all of the observing that is possible with the currently available instruments. These would be in the form of preprogrammed observing sequences. It should be possible to resort the queue so that the next observation to take place comes to the front of the queue. This sorting will be based on properties of the individual observing sequences, current site conditions, and other rules established by the observatory directorate.
While these rules have yet to be worked out one could imagine rules such as “no more than 15% of observing will be preempted” or “a 10% overhead to the prime observing project is acceptable in order to pick up observations in similar parts of the sky with identical filters”.
 
Thus queue scheduling is a superset of preprogrammed observing, with similar requirements. As the costs of implementing such a scheduler are currently difficult to estimate it may prove necessary to implement it in a future phase of the project. The system design, if it does not include a scheduler, should specifically allow for its future implementation.
 


	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

Remote operations includes both remote observing, with the science observer off- site, and remote telescope operation, with control of the telescope also off- site. It also covers remote eavesdropping, monitoring, configuration, and diagnosis. (There will always be support staff on-site during observations, however.) The requirements for supporting remote operations are:
A.
All software should be developed to permit remote operations. There should be no conceptual difference between software working on-site and remotely.
B.
All observing facilities should work both on-site and off-site. It should be possible to do full operations remotely.
C. Team observing, with multiple observers at different sites should be supported.
D.
It must be possible to restrict specific operations to specific remote sites. For exam- ple, at the Mauna Kea site, remote telescope control might be restricted to Hale Pohaku. The method used to restrict such operations should be independent of the operations themselves, and dynamic.
 
 
 
 
 
 


	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	



 
 
 


	

	

	

	

OBSERVING MODE REQUIREMENTS
E. It is assumed that the hardware involved in remote operations has been specified with sufficient bandwidth to support remote operations. However, we will take advantage of commercially available protocols such as ISDN, TCP/IP, Internet, etc.
 
The choice of the name remote operations is meant to suggest an entire category of opera- tions, such as remote observing but also remote access for diagnostic support. In this sense it is more general than pure remote observing.
 
Despite the obvious limitations introduced by the link bandwidths available at the differ- ent locations, the system shall be totally transparent to local or remote use. It is only nec- essary that the functionality of the system be transparent, it is accepted that the speed of the link will determine the perceived transparency of the system. However the system design should minimize the impact of link bandwidth on transparency.
 
Security of operation shall be considered and might imply different operation levels and privileges at different sites.
 
It is required that the remote operations software be considered from the beginning in the Gemini 8m Telescopes software design, to avoid redesign later. This should reduce the amount of specific software needed for remote operations, as the common layers of soft- ware shall cope from the beginning with a distributed environment.


	

	

	

	

Remote control means that the function normally associated with a local Telescope Opera- tor, that of entering telescope control commands, would be available from a remote site. In practice remote control will be restricted to the Gemini 8m Telescopes Enclosure and Gemini 8m Telescopes Control Facility. The philosophy behind this is that, for safety con- siderations, telescope control commands cannot be issued without a staff member (not necessarily the same person) having direct access to:
•
a hard wired “stop” button
• real time video and audio
• control of the telescope


	

	

	

	

Remote observing means that users shall be able to observe from a remote site such as Cerro Tololo, Hilo or even home Institutes. This possibility has to be provided on the Gemini 8m Telescopes.
 
The extent to which realistic observing conditions can be reproduced depends, of course, largely on the link bandwidth available. Experience with previous telescopes at other
 
 


	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	



 
 
 


	

	

	

	

OBSERVING MODE REQUIREMENTS
observatories shows, however, that, even with very limited bandwidths, remote observing can be implemented, provided the software is suitable for this.
 
Remote observing, as meant in this context, does not mean remote control. Remote users shall normally interact with the system via
•
operators at the Gemini 8m Telescopes control facility
• operators at the Gemini 8m Telescopes site facility
• operators at the Gemini 8m Telescopes base facility
• operators at the Gemini 8m Telescopes remote operations facility
• via the scheduler program
and shall not control any part of the Gemini 8m Telescopes directly.
 
In the last case they will use a remote User interface to submit commands to the Gemini 8m Telescopes scheduler at the Gemini 8m Telescopes site.


	

	

	

	

In this mode the monitor's screen appears as a duplicate of that seen by the observer. The monitor's keyboard would not have any effect on the observer's environment.


	

	

	

	

Remote monitoring is the simplest level of remote observing. It is sometimes called 'eavesdropping'. It is a requirement for the Gemini 8m Telescopes operation and will complement service observing, making it friendlier for users. Remote monitoring coincides to a large extent with multipoint monitoring, but allows the remote user to “pick and choose” the information that is displayed on the remote screen. There is no requirement that the remote screen be a duplicate of the local screen. The remote key- board will have no effect on the local user's environment.
 
A remote observer might also need a real-time video and voice link with the operator in the control room, perhaps using a portable video camera which the operator can position as necessary. It is assumed this facility is provided entirely by hardware, and is beyond the scope of the Gemini software.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 


	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	



 
 
 


	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

OBSERVING MODE REQUIREMENTS
 
Quite apart from remote observing, remote access to the Gemini 8m Telescopes and its instruments is required for monitoring and diagnostic purposes. This might be necessary to back up local users expertise and to help in case of problems. Remote access, in this case, must be possible from the Gemini 8m Telescopes base facility.
 
Distributed access to the Gemini 8m Telescopes software, once implemented. also allows, without extra requirements, local access (at the Gemini 8m Telescopes site) or remote access (Gemini 8m Telescopes support, base, and remote operations facilities).
 


	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

Service observing implies that the Gemini staff are responsible for performing the actual data collection for the astronomer. A special case of service observing, queue-based, is given earlier, and assumes that the observing program can be executed with minimal inter- action with the client astronomer. The more general case, where a science observer is present on site and the client astronomer is remotely connected, is considered here. The requirements specific to service observing are:
A.
The observing program must be automated, requiring little human interaction during the observation. The means that the Gemini software must include a sufficiently rich pro- gramming environment to make this feasible. In addition, this should be a visually-ori- ented environment providing a simple, easy-to-use interface to the astronomer.
B.
This programming environment should be available both to the astronomer, for develop- ing the program, and to the observer, for review and adjustment of the program. This access may or may not be done concurrently on a shared environment.
C.
The programming environment should allow for the communication of special notes, instructions, and comments from the astronomer to the observer, possibly involving multi- media techniques. The use of this feature would, however, be discouraged for queue-based observing.
 
Observing, as such, is the purpose of the Gemini 8m Telescopes system. But interactive observing is perhaps, in some cases, not the most efficient way to achieve this, although it will be necessary for certain kinds of observations (such as adaptive optics) and in certain phases (such as commissioning and test periods).
 
Service observing, on the other hand, means that the observing program can be performed by someone other than the proposing astronomer. It will be done on his behalf at a conve- nient moment that is not exactly predefined and may be intermixed with programs from other users.
 
 
 
 


	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	



 
 
 


	

	

	

	

OBSERVING SUPPORT
Service observing requires switching during the night among telescope modes and instruments. This might typically be a few times (2) per night, when sky conditions change.
 
It requires also that the observing program is so well specified that it can be executed by someone else. In other words, it requires a computer executable observing pro- gram.
 
Service observing requires a suitable organization to support it, and first of all, con- siderable experience with a smooth running system. For these reasons it can only be applied to the Gemini 8m Telescopes once the Classical observing requirement has been fulfilled and been in operation for a while. Nevertheless, the software and data structures to support classical observing which have to be present in a system that is only interactive at the start might require considerable redesign to be adapted later to the service observing requirement.


	

	

	

	

 


	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

To achieve efficient service observing, queue observing, and flexible scheduling, it should be possible to carry out observations automatically, in accordance with pre- defined sequences of exposures, as is commonly done in space observatories.
 
This corresponds to what is meant by planned observing, which still requires compe- tent monitoring at the Gemini 8m Telescopes site or remotely.
 
At the same time, one does not want to lose the advantages and the extra flexibility of ground-based astronomy. So whichever scheme is adopted to perform automatic sequences, interaction shall be allowed at the desired level (for example, only on error conditions, any time the user is allowed to break a sequence, etc.).
 


	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

Flexible scheduling means the possibility of reacting to changes in weather and other conditions by allocating the current use of the telescope to the optimal observing pro- gram for those conditions.
 
It will require the use of service and/or remote observing, as users cannot stay around indefinitely waiting for the conditions required by their program. This can be comple-
 
 
 


	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	



 
 
 


	

	

	

	

GENERAL SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS
mented by remote monitoring, if users can be on standby at a suitably equipped remote site.
 
Flexible scheduling requires the possibility to change telescope scheduling quickly, exchanging observing programs. This can be achieved only with the help of appropriate scheduling software, which must advise the operations team on the best choice to make which is compatible with the relative priorities of the various observing programs. It should be recognized that such ‘expert scheduling’ software does not currently exist - it should be a requirement of such software that it have an operational mode which merely supports the decision making process by presenting appropriate information.
 
Flexible scheduling requires switching during the night among telescope modes and instruments (typically 2 times per night). Thus flexible scheduling is a superset of queue scheduling, with similar requirements.
 
 


	

	

	

	

 


	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

These requirements apply to the commands and replies between sub-systems (including status information requests and replies), information flow to and from on-line databases, and commands and software for the IOCs.
• Requirements
A. The syntax of control flow commands is to be consistent across the system, whether accessing workstation software or IOC software. See Section 3.2.5 on page 3-6.
B. All subsystems must respond to a common set of commands to test operational status, inquiries as to version, perform self-tests, etc. These common commands are described in Section 5.3 on page 5-2.
All IOC subsystems must respond to additional common commands for such activities as start, stop, initialize, reset parameters, etc. These IOC common commands are described in Section 5.3 on page 5-2.
C. The support structure for communicating commands must be reliable, with a uniform ACK/NAK protocol adopted across all systems. Timeouts must be supported at approxi- mately 500 msec.
D. Handshaking of commands between IOCs must occur within 100-200 msec, signaling acceptance of each command.
 
 
 


	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	



 
 
 


	

	

	

	

GENERAL SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS
E. For commands allowing delayed replies, timeouts for that reply must also be sup- ported.
F.
Peak control information within the system is expected to be 100 TPS. This assumes
bridging between communication sections, to isolate traffic in relevant sections only.
 


	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

The following requirements apply to the control and transfer of astronomical data in all forms (science, engineering, reference, etc.)


	

	

	

	

A. Data flow. Data from detectors must be stored in the most effective method permit- ted by available technology. Astronomical data is often detector readout limited so that disk access and data transfer times are not significant. Maximum acceptable readout time for detector data is very dependent on detector type and size as well as the intended application:
1.  
For focusing and related activities, maximum acceptable detector readout time is about 0.1 sec, though only a portion of the detector may be read during that time.
2.   For mosaicked, large optical detectors, a full readout of the detector must be done in about 2 or 3 minutes.
B.
Concurrent data access and display. Since the Gemini system supports monitoring of operation, there must be the capability of providing multiple, simultaneous access to data. Data transfer between the virtual telescope system and attached workstations therefore imposes significant transfer requirements on the LAN. The LAN must sup- port a transfer rate of 20-40 Mbits/second.
C.
Data acquisition format. Data is normally acquired as uncompressed data, but may be compressed using a loss-less compression technique for transmission from the Gemini system or across the system LAN. The goal of compression is to minimize bandwidth impact on the LAN and WAN and to save space on removable media.
For data that requires preprocessing, such as infrared detector data, only the prepro- cessed data is stored.
D.
Storage of data. Data from all instruments and detectors is stored as compressed data, using a standard format. There is a first level of storage within IOCs, to secure data in the event of link failures.
A second level of storage is on the Gemini system data disk(s), possibly also on removable media. Quick-look data quality assessment is done using this level.
 
 
 
 
 


	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	



 
 
 


	

	

	

	

OPERATION PRIVILEGES, PROTECTIONS, AND PROCEDURES
Archiving of data is automatically done while in observing and maintenance level opera- tion to the Gemini Archive subsystem. Shipping of data to a central archive follows later.
E. Data transmission format. Data is transmitted between Gemini and home Institutes using a FITS format and contains all header information provided with the data.
F. System-wide data capacity. The data capacity of the system is limited by transfer meth- ods and technology, as well as archiving capacity on site. The system data capacity is capable of retaining 7 days of data produced by the largest instrument, the last 3 days of which must be available interactively from hard disk or similar medium.
 


	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

Video information originates from target acquisition, guiding, and site monitoring cam- eras. The requirements for transferring video data are:
A. The system must allow for fast transmission of rough images every 0.5 sec. This may be assisted through the use of data-loss compression techniques (e.g. JPEG, MPEG, etc).
B. In addition, there is the need for transmission of images matching the original resolution. This high-quality transmission must require less than 20 sec, and can only be assisted with loss-less compression.


	

	

	

	

 
To preserve the integrity of the system, there must be a system of privileges established at each operating level of the system. These privileges should be determined in a simple manner during logging into the system.
 
Protection against accidental interference is to be implemented using an Access Mode Allocation system that dynamically identifies and assigns resources as needed. Critical resources (those that can support only a restricted number of simultaneous uses) are assigned solely through this allocation system. The allocation system must ensure that the system cannot remain deadlocked with respect to this resource allocation.
 
Finally, procedures must be implemented for convenience and system integrity, to sim- plify and codify common tasks. The tasks that require such procedures include:
• Telescope start-up and shutdown.
• Telescope system self-testing.
• Instrument start-up and shut-down. This is not permitted to interfere with telescope operation.
• Instrument self-testing and self-diagnosis This is not permitted to interfere with tele- scope operation.
 


	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	



 
 
 


	

	

	

	

GENERAL PERFORMANCE AND RELIABILITY REQUIREMENTS
• Configuration and reconfiguration.
• Dynamic reconfiguration of observing configuration (beam switching without restarting instruments and telescope).
• The control software should know what subsystems are installed and their status at all times.


	

	

	

	

 
 


	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

The Gemini software should have no hard restrictions on the number of simultaneous users, but should allow for policy decisions that do restrict the amount of simulta- neous access.
 


	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

The response time requirements vary with the function. The appropriate limits are:
A.Every command must be accepted/rejected within 2 sec and before the correspond- ing action occurs. (This is different than the ACK/NAK response of the communica- tions protocol - here, the target system must have examined the command and verified its validity.
B. Status display update must be within 4 sec at the local stations (certain functions, such as telescope position, may have tighter constraints). Remote station update response is given in the Requirements for Remote Operations section.
C. Requests of subsystems for status information must be answered within 5 sec and be possible in maintenance level operation.
D. Requirements for response times within the user interfaces are given in the User Interface requirements section.
 


	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

All software bugs should be logged and then fixed as soon as possible after detection. The goal is to have restart conditions occur only on hardware failure.
 
Fault recovery, exception handling, fail-safe checks, etc. should be used to improve reliability.
 
 
 
 


	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	



 
 
 


	

	

	

	

TEST AND CHECKOUT REQUIREMENTS
 
The telescope and instrument software shall contain built-in test (BIT) facilities to verify Gemini 8m Telescopes system and Gemini 8m Telescopes software performances.
 
Every Gemini 8m Telescopes software module shall have corresponding test specifica- tions to check normal operation of releases, to be used both for acceptance tests and as an on-line test procedure.
 
The Gemini 8m Telescopes control software shall also provide for execution of self-test sequences of the Gemini 8m Telescopes system and subsystems. These shall automati- cally exercise all subsystems present in a given operational configuration.
 
Regression tests should be a part of every Gemini 8m Telescopes software package.


	

	

	

	

 


	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

Subsystems must notify the user when faults occur. This notification must be specific as to origin and problem. The notification must also be capable of being electronically logged. It may also prove useful to have multiple levels of fault notification such as detailed, ver- bose, short, etc. to aid in tracking down problems.
 


	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

Should a subsystem fail (e.g. one detector, one instrument) predefined procedures must exist to redefine the environment in such a way that operation can restart with the remain- ing equipment.
 
In case of computer hardware failure concerning the user station equipment, it shall be possible to transfer control from one user station to another via a simple software reconfig- uration procedure.
 
In the case of IOC failure, no transfer of control to another IOC will be possible, due to the local connections and interfaces to the control electronics. In this case there shall be a pro- cedure to replace faulty cards and/or assemblies. If it is possible to observe with that par- ticular IOC in a failed state (in general, this is limited to IOCs that are associated with individual scientific instruments) then it must be possible to reconfigure the system to do so.
 
 
 


	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	



 
 
 


	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

CONSTRAINTS
 
Full redundancy is not a requirement of the Gemini 8m Telescopes and it will be acceptable to have to replace units in case of failure.
 
There are subsystems which are relatively inexpensive to support as redundant sys- tems, such as telescope control computers. For each area where redundancy is decided to be cost effective, procedures for switching to the backup system will be established. There is no requirement for automatic switching to the backup system.
 
All communication shall be based on the use of standard communication protocols, where retry procedures are applied (a form of software redundancy) as part of the protocol.
 
Certain network concepts may be preferable as they offer intrinsic redundancy (e.g. double loops) and re-routing possibilities in case of node failures (single point failure protection).


	

	

	

	

The Gemini system software is designed under the following constraints.
 


	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

A.There should be no restrictions imposed by the software on users. Only policy deci- sions (permissions, access privileges, etc.) should prevent any user from accessing any part of the Gemini system from any local or remote station.
B.Similar functionality should be presented to the users using similar user interfaces. However, user interfaces should clearly reflect access modes and operating levels.
 


	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

Hardware constraints are covered in the individual chapters the Software Design Description.
 


	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

There are a number of general constraints placed on the Gemini Software. These are:
A.Commercial packages, off-the-shelf public domain software, and standards are to be used whenever feasible.
 
 
 
 


	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	



 
 
 


	

	

	

	

CONSTRAINTS
B..Existing external software will be integrated with the Gemini software. The interfaces involved in this integration are considered part of the Gemini software system.
C.
All Gemini software is to be developed using standard methodologies and development environments. One of the goals of Gemini software is that all components be easily (pref- erably automatically) combined into an integrated system.
D. Gemini software developers should maintain accurate change logs showing software modifications as they are applied to the system software.
E. Gemini software developers should adhere to a standard method for the reporting and recording of errors from both internal and external sources.
F.
Gemini software should be developed in evolutionary fashion, using the CVS version control system.
G.
All Gemini subsystem packages should include as part of the software both a simulator module for inclusion in the virtual telescope (see Design constraints, below), and user interface modules for the user interface environments that the subsystem will be operating in. The interfaces required of these user interface modules are described in Section 3.3 on page 3-6.
H. All Gemini software is to be fully documented, internally with appropriate comments, and external documentation. External documentation must include Unix-style man pages.
I. All Gemini subsystem packages must provide modules for the testing and diagnosis of the subsystem.
J.
All instrumentation control software must provide full access to all instrument function- ality. It is likely that different user interface modules (see above) would present different portions of this functionality to the user. The information required of each interface mod- ule is found in the Functional Requirements specifications for each instrument.
K.
All Gemini software must be version labeled, both in source and binary form. The ver- sion information is to be retrievable from executing software via control commands.
 


	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

A. There are different requirements for software running on different layers. For example, strict real-time control is restricted to the IOC layer.
B. Also, the use of a virtual-telescope model in the Gemini system means that the integrated system can be tested and developed independently of the target hardware. This is useful not only in the use of the telescope simulator during science planning, but in maintenance and testing as well. Therefore all hardware subsystems must provide a software simulation module (as stated earlier) that responds in reasonable fashion to commands directed at that hardware. This simulation may require a standard environment, such as VxWorks, EPICS, and VME crate/cpu, but it cannot require any hardware specific to the application.
 
 
 


	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	



 
 
 


	

	

	

	

CONSTRAINTS
C. Gemini subsystem should be as self-contained and autonomous as possible, thereby decreasing the functional width of the interface to the rest of the Gemini system.
D. No subsystem package should make any assumptions about the surrounding envi- ronment beyond that provided in the interface specifications.

The final purpose of the Gemini 8m Telescopes software is the acquisition of astronomical data in digital form in the most efficient way.
 
To achieve this, many other data concerning the telescope and instruments (parameters) and control commands will have to be exchanged between different processing units in order to setup and control telescope and instruments. Additionally, video and voice data are also necessary (for example, field monitors).
 


	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

Control information must be transferred, typically in the form of commands and replies from users, to telescope and instruments. Replies might contain status information and, in general, data concerning instruments and telescopes, to be stored together with the astro- nomical data.
 
Control information on all controlled variables must be provided by all subsystems on request. No request for information shall produce a delay of control activities or locking, even if the corresponding equipment is not available or faulty.
 
Delay times for the exchange of control information must stay within precise time limits to be defined in “General Description” in Chapter 2. One can afford to retransmit com- mands in case of transmission error or collision, but the protocol has to be predictable in that commands cannot get lost and replies have to come back reliably.
 
 


	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	



 
 
 


	

	

	

	

DATA SPECIFICATIONS
In a number of cases, synchronization with the Time Reference System at the Gemini 8m Telescopes site is also necessary.
 
Access to control parameters, telescope and instrument information for monitoring or other use makes a significant contribution to the control flow, and may be logged at quite high rates for short periods (i.e. up to 200 Hz for some information).
 
It is explicitly required that all such information is available to the Gemini 8m Tele- scopes software and is capable of being available to all users of the Gemini 8m Tele- scopes, subject only to restrictions with respect to updating. It must also be possible to restrict user access to such information.
 
In particular also, the meteorological information coming from a weather station should be available centrally.
 


	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

 


	

	

	

	

Detector data must be acquired and stored in the most effective way technology will allow; effectiveness should be evaluated in terms of cost, space requirements, lon- gevity, and speed. This shall lead to the definition of a Gemini 8m Telescopes stan- dard, used on all instruments. In general, operational overheads must be kept as low as possible, to maximize actual observing times.
 
Intermediate storage of raw data in memory on different nodes and in different for- mats should be kept to a minimum. However, there must be at least two copies - one to secure data as acquired and one to do assessment of data quality on-line (this last copy preferably on removable media).
 
The link chosen to transfer data should represent as small a bottleneck as possible for data acquisition.


	

	

	

	

Normally, raw data will be acquired and stored as such for quick look evaluations. There might, however, be cases (for example, infrared detectors) where fast prepro- cessing is needed and where, therefore, raw data will not be stored as such, but in a preprocessed format.
 
 
 
 
 


	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	



 
 
 


	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

OPERATION
 
Astronomical data will have to be transported between GEMINI and the home institutes of visiting astronomers in FITS format (as defined by NOST 100-1.0, “Definition of the Flex- ible Image Transport System (FITS)”, NASA Science Office of Standards and Technol- ogy).
 


	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

TV data concerning site monitoring and voice need to be capable of being available at all operations facilities. It will be a question of interfacing and bandwidth costs whether such information is actually available at a specific location. It is not a requirement that point to point video be available between Gemini 8m Telescopes operations facilities. It is a requirement that voice connectivity, perhaps point to point, be available on a permanent connection.
 
Other astronomical information such as that coming from sky field monitors, autoguider cameras and sky monitoring devices such as cloud and seeing monitors shall also be capa- ble of being available.


	

	

	

	

 


	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

Operation of telescope, instruments and subsystems can be carried out at three different levels. There will be parameters associated with each level of operation which define the status of the system and / or control the system. The specific access by different types of users to particular parameters of the different levels are given in Section 2.5.8 on page 2- 5.


	

	

	

	

This is the normal operational mode. It allows a certain number of embedded tests, nor- mally at a fairly high level. Monitoring is also done at this level.
 
It is anticipated that all user categories have access to this level.


	

	

	

	

This allows maintenance tables (for example, with instrument parameters) to be updated.
 
 
 
 


	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	



 
 
 


	

	

	

	

OPERATION
It is anticipated that the majority of parameters at this level will be accessed by oper- ations and development staff.


	

	

	

	

This allows the installation and testing of new packages or new releases. Any low level test can be performed in this mode.
 
It shall be possible to update all non-protected parameter values, i.e. those not used by operations at observing level.
 
Access to this level will be extremely limited.
 


	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

Privileges and protections are also important parameters to define user operations.


	

	

	

	

A further subdivision within the levels can be achieved by implementing privileges associated with categories of users or with the location of the user station (local or remote). For example some users might only be allowed monitoring, as a subsystem is in use by someone else.


	

	

	

	

Protections must also be enforced (see also Security in Section 3.5.6 on page 3- 20) among users and the operational software should indicate clearly to users the current operation level and check the compatibility between subsystems in different modes.
 


	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

The capacity of the system can be expressed in terms of nodes, which is defined as the number of workstations, or in terms of users, which is defined as the sum total of users at all the nodes. The capacity requirements will be expressed in terms of nodes.
 
Each node will have the capability to run at all operation levels.
 
When the Gemini 8m Telescopes telescope is used in its normal observing mode, there will be a single operator node for the telescope and two data acquisition and instrument control nodes.
 
 
 


	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	



 
 
 


	

	

	

	

OPERATION
Some tests might be run in parallel on instruments that do not have the light beam at that moment, so in principle additional nodes might be working at the same time. The system will provide for one auxiliary data acquisition and instrument control nodes.
 
In addition, the system must support off-site observing modes. The system will provide for a single off-site data acquisition and instrument control node - to be located at either the Gemini 8m Telescopes Site Support or Base Facility.
 
One supervisor will monitor the system, and other users might need to monitor the run- ning of observing programs, locally or remotely. The system will provide for a single local monitoring node and a single remote monitoring node.
 
As a conclusion, the Gemini 8m Telescopes control software shall allow simultaneous operation of up to six active control nodes and up to two more monitoring nodes (one local and one remote) without appreciable degradation of performance.
 
In practice the operation and facilities foreseen so far for the Gemini 8m Telescopes will limit this number to a maximum in the order of three active nodes, but the Gemini 8m Telescopes computers and software shall be capable of coping with the load of 10 active nodes, should the case arise.
 


	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

This section is intentionally kept at the level of performance criteria rather than response times (found in Section 2.11.2 on page 2- 22). Every command must be acknowledged in a positive or negative way before the occurrence of the corresponding action within given response times.
 


	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

There must be automatic procedures to implement startup and shutdown of the telescope and instruments. These must allow startup and shutdown of instruments independently of the telescope and without affecting the telescope operation.
 
Reconfiguration procedures must exist, to change the observing environment.
 
The definition of the observing environments must be dynamic, i.e. feasible during opera- tions without the need to restart everything. The same applies to the related light path.
 
Operations staff have privileges to change the environment, meaning selecting a suitable combination of instruments.
 
 
 


	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	



 
 
 


	

	

	

	

EXTERNAL INTERFACE REQUIREMENTS
The operational software should know which subsystems are installed and opera- tional at any given time.


	

	

	

	

 


	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

The user interface defines the way users see the Gemini 8m Telescopes system. Given the large number of instruments, there can be many different stations which are active at the same time. It is essential for operational and maintenance reasons that, in spite of the obvious differences of the setups and commands available, the same philoso- phy is applied throughout. This calls for a homogeneous user interface, which can be achieved only by applying the same user interface tools to the whole project, provid- ing the Gemini 8m Telescopes user interface's ‘look and feel’.
 
The user interface should not be seen as a package linked to a specific computer. Given the requirement to be able to access the Gemini 8m Telescopes from several points, the user interface should rather be seen as a package to be callable from a large number of stations, depending on where a user is. It should also be network transparent so that it does not matter where it is being run.
 
The user interface tools shall be based on standards, defined in Section 4.2.5 on page 4- 7, which will be portable across different computer hardware platforms (Portable User Interface Toolkit). The intent of a portability requirement is to facilitate migrat- ing existing and future Gemini systems to different hardware as the need arises. It is the current intent to limit the selection of computer hardware platforms to as few as is practical.
 


	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

Main processor computer hardware requirements will be defined in the Hardware constraints (see Section 3.4.2 on page 3- 12).
 
This section deals instead with external hardware interfaces, namely the ones from the microprocessors to the control electronics. The definition of these terms is as fol- lows:
• main processors - these are the computers with which the user interacts
• control electronics - these are the computers controlling the instruments
 
 
 
 


	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	



 
 
 


	

	

	

	

EXTERNAL INTERFACE REQUIREMENTS
• microprocessors - these are computers embedded in the instrument (for instance a DSP or transputer required for array control functions, or special purpose controllers for the primary mirror support actuators).
 
Standard interfaces to the control electronics shall be available, in the form of:
• standard bus systems
• a standard set of interface cards to be used on all the subsystems and instruments
• a standard software skeleton running on the control electronics
 
The existence of hardware standards is clearly essential for maintenance and repairs. It is also essential to avoid software duplication, and to simplify the Gemini 8m Telescopes software. Microprocessor software in particular tends to contain hardware specific soft- ware, though one should try to keep it as hardware independent as possible, isolating dif- ferent software layers.
 
The standard software must be adequate for the real-time requirements and must offer drivers to the standard electronics to be used on all the Gemini 8m Telescopes software subsystems and instruments.
 
Links between electronics interfaces and main processors must meet the requirements imposed by the data specifications (see Section 3.1 on page 3- 1).
 


	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

The Gemini 8m Telescopes software covers all aspects of control and data acquisition related to the telescope, instruments, and auxiliary instrumentation.
 
It also covers all the operational aspects of the Gemini 8m Telescopes, including on-line scheduling and rescheduling.
 
There is also software which, although it will be interfaced to the Gemini 8m Telescopes, is referred to as external. The external software consists of:
• commercial software integrated into the Gemini 8m Telescopes software (e.g. DBMS)
• preexisting software used in the Gemini 8m Telescopes (e.g. image processing systems, star catalogues)
• software associated with visitor instrumentation
• embedded software dedicated to hardware control, but not communicating on-line with the other Gemini 8m Telescopes software (in general this would be microprocessor code)
 
 
 


	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	



 
 
 


	

	

	

	

EXTERNAL INTERFACE REQUIREMENTS
The Gemini 8m Telescopes software must interface to the external software and clearly the interfaces are fully part of the Gemini 8m Telescopes software.


	

	

	

	

In order to make efficient use of the telescope, to support different observing modes, and to support the versatility requirements, some form of on-line image (or pixel) quick-look analysis is required. The following statements are proposed:
 
“It shall be possible to monitor the quality (image quality, spectral resolution, signal to noise, etc.) of the astronomical data as it comes in.
 
Standard reduction procedures should be available for basic on-line calibrations of the observed data. Ultimately, one would like to have fully reduced and calibrated data at the end of the observations. Advanced pipeline procedures might make this feasible, at least for observations of a standard nature.”
 
The above statements define the goal of quick-look analysis for the Gemini 8m Tele- scopes.
 
Quick-look data processing should be provided on the Gemini 8m Telescopes, with procedures suitable for fast on-line data preprocessing. A prerequisite for this is that acquired data are made available as directly as possible in a common format, and that all additional data related to an exposure and logging information are made available on-line at the same time.
 
Quick-look should be usable within exposure sequences to provide results and feed- back parameters to the control software in a programmed way, without the need for manual intervention. This document does not try to be specific about the require- ments for Quick-look other than that it should be synchronous.
 
Near-line processing should be available for simple data reductions required for data integrity validation (i.e. remove instrument and observatory effects so the observer can make decisions about further observing actions). This data reduction proceeds sequentially through requests, but asynchronously from data acquistion. In particular, data acquisition takes precedence over near-line data reduction.
 
Off-line pixel processing for full data reduction should also exist at the Gemini 8m Telescopes site, but does not have any interface to the Gemini 8m Telescopes soft- ware. The Astronomical communities have made considerable investments in image processing software, and therefore, compatibility with and adaptations to these pack- ages must be sought.
 
 
 


	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	



 
 
 


	

	

	

	

EXTERNAL INTERFACE REQUIREMENTS
It should also be noted that some Gemini 8m Telescopes subsystems, such as adaptive optics, may require their own special on-line pixel processing software, which is better defined in the requirements for those subsystems. This is largely due to the difficulty of applying on-line the same algorithms used for full off-line reductions — in general due to the time critical nature of the image processing needs.
 
The same situation might also occur with other instruments, where specific observer sup- port software has to be foreseen for on-line use.
 
In all these cases the specific on-line (quick-look) software development shall be seen as a subset of the development for the off-line data reduction system, to avoid as far as possi- ble duplication of development effort.


	

	

	

	

The output format of the Gemini 8m Telescopes data must be compatible with the GEM- INI archive requirements.
 
As comparisons with previous data might be of great value and affect the actual observing program, on-line interactive access to the data archiving system should exist, so that access to this database is possible for Gemini 8m Telescopes users.
 
The specific types of data available; flat fields, calibrations, science exposures, etc.; the amount of a specific exposure available; header only, averaged exposure, complete raw data set; and the time frame within which such data will be made available; same night, weekly, after proprietary period; will be established by the Gemini Archiving Require- ments.
 
Computer access to star catalogues is also required, so that an automatic selection of can- didate guide and standard stars can be made.


	

	

	

	

The Gemini 8m Telescopes software must be able to interface with all commercial soft- ware packages available on the Gemini 8m Telescopes and integrated into the Gemini 8m Telescopes operation.
 
A relevant example of such a package is a general database management system (DBMS), where operational information such as schedules, logs, problem reports and maintenance information related to various pieces of equipment should be kept.
 
 
 
 
 


	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	



 
 
 


	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

EXTERNAL INTERFACE REQUIREMENTS
 
Being in itself a distributed telescope system and having a large number of instru- ments, the Gemini 8m Telescopes system has internal communication needs.


	

	

	

	

The LAN shall support the majority of the Gemini 8m Telescopes system internal communication needs. This LAN must be capable of dealing both with the data band- widths required (at peak and on average) and with the required response times and synchronization needs. This LAN shall be supplemented with a Local Time Bus, for distribution of absolute and relative time signals, and both a digital reflective memory bus and an analog event-based bus, for distribution of signals with requirements not satisfied by a LAN.
 
Independently of the physical layout of such a network, its functional requirements can be split into several categories:
• Local coordination and synchronization needs within a subsystem (for example, coordination of active support system for primary mirror, bi-directional traffic of commands/replies). This layer could be considered as internal to a given sub- system or instrument, but as more than one subsystem might need it, one should aim for a unique solution at the hardware and software level.
• Global synchronization needs, such as the universal time synchronization require- ment. The required accuracy will be defined in Section 2.9 on page 2- 19.
• Exchange of control information, in the form of commands and status information. (Bi-directional traffic) (see also Section 3.1.1 on page 3- 1).
• Collection and transfer (for archiving or remote access) of raw astronomical data. The capacity will be defined in Section 2.9 on page 2- 19(see also Section 3.1.2 on page 3- 2).
• Access from Wide Area Network (WAN) for remote diagnostics and monitoring from operations facilities (Bi-directional traffic).
 
No distinction is made here between WAN and point to point links as there shall be no difference in the software between the two cases. However the system architecture will be designed so as to minimize the communication load placed on peer and higher level networks.
 
Control data and astronomical data have already been defined in the Data specifica- tions (see Section 3.1 on page 3- 1). The reason for repeating them here is to have a complete view of the required network functionality.
 
 
 
 


	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	



 
 
 


	

	

	

	

GENERAL CONSTRAINTS
To eliminate conceptual access problems, while coping with different bandwidths, LAN and WAN interfaces shall be homogeneous and shall be based on standards which allow migration on different media, should they become required during the Gemini 8m Tele- scopes project life.
 
For maintenance reasons and hardware independence, a clear hierarchical model must be implemented, supporting separation of logical and physical layers, e.g. ISO/OSI model. It is recognized that this hierarchy may need to be violated for (in general) performance rea- sons. This results in point-to-point connections between peer systems or direct connec- tions bypassing the hierarchy.
 
Network redundancy should also be considered in the design phase as a way to increase reliability and security, in particular for control information.
 
Due to the uncertain future of the Internet, only non-essential tasks may employ it. All essential tasks, not including remote observing, must take place on resources controlled by the project (such as leased lines).
 
Violation of the hierarchical nature of the system can lead to testing and maintenance problems. The use of these features must be limited and constrained by the following guidelines:
1.   Peer-to-peer connectivity should only be used to overcome a demonstrated performance problem.
2.   Bypassing the hierarchy (connected between grandmother and granddaughter with no path through the mother) should only be used for transmission of status information or bulk data, not control flow.


	

	

	

	

 


	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

It is envisaged that observing astronomers who have travelled to the Gemini 8m Tele- scopes site will make use of the Gemini 8m Telescopes control room facilities. This will allow centralized support and coordination of their operations, providing both operations support for individual instruments and supervision for all of them.
 
However, even at the Gemini 8m Telescopes site there will be users (e.g. software devel- opment and maintenance staff) installing or enhancing other parts of the system, possibly working directly at the telescope.
 
Finally, in the case of remote operations, other users (e.g. support staff) might be on Cerro Tololo or in Hilo.
 


	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	



 
 
 


	

	

	

	

GENERAL CONSTRAINTS
To allow coordination both locally at the Gemini 8m Telescopes site between the var- ious users and with remote users, the software shall support access to the system from any user station. It will then be an operational decision, implying privileges and pri- orities for the various categories of users, and definition of what a given user can actually do.
 
Access from any user station will make user stations in principle identical and soft- ware configurable as the user station of this or that subsystem. This should greatly simplify the coordination problem posed by the large number of simultaneous users (as already described in the Capacity requirements, Section 3.2.2).
 


	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

There are a number of constraints for the Gemini 8m Telescopes computer hardware. Although some of these constraints may appear redundant the project recognizes that:
• during the next 5 to 10 years new hardware will be available with features and costs that could benefit the project
• the hardware chosen as the standard at this point of time may be no longer available at some point in the future
• the cost of maintaining an existing hardware standard, even if available, may exceed the costs of adopting a new hardware standard
 
These constraints recognize that the majority of the expense in changing hardware standards is the cost of the software. Particular constraints are:
A. Computers used at the Gemini 8m Telescopes site, particularly in the test phase when they are outside the control room and near the subsystem under test, shall be checked against altitude and humidity specifications for the Gemini 8m Telescopes site (see also [EDS] in Section 1.3).
B. Computer hardware must be able to run the Gemini 8m Telescopes software envi- ronment (operating systems, Gemini 8m Telescopes software) and provide compati- bility in data format (identical internal data representation).
C. Common development and implementation tools must be both available and sup- ported
D. Identical network access must be supported
E. Local processing power must be such that telescope and instrument control does not represent a significant overhead in the whole process of executing an observing pro- gram (the overhead, if any, should be limited by the time it takes for physical devices to act)
 
 
 
 


	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	



 
 
 


	

	

	

	

GENERAL CONSTRAINTS
F. The choice of a scalable hardware architecture with computers at various performance levels should solve the problem of adequate on-line data assessment, as the amount of this activity is very variable and dependent upon the kind of detector and method used.
G. Due to the limited bandwidths which may be available remotely, there will be constraints on the functionality of remote operations and access.
 
Depending on funding, it is probably reasonable here to make a minimum and a desirable specification. The minimum situation could also coincide with what is needed in the test period before coming to full remote operation.
 
In any case, remote operation must include remote monitoring from the Gemini 8m Tele- scopes base facilities, together with access tools for diagnostic and test use. It should be a goal to support remote observing from the Gemini 8m Telescopes base facilities.
 


	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

Some of the general requirements which have a direct effect on the software are here explicitly transformed into software constraints.
 
These are:
A. Individual instruments must be able to run fully independently.
B. Telescope software at the two telescopes must be maintained to be identical in the upper layers (even if hardware should differ).
C. Additions of new instruments should aim, as a goal, at introducing no modification to already operational parts. Modifications should be confined to the operational procedures and should not affect the bulk of the existing software.
D. Switching to different configurations must be possible at any time with appropriate pro- cedures.
E. There must be easy procedures to reconfigure the system when subsystems are modified or removed.
F. The number of main packages of software must be kept to a minimum to facilitate main- tenance, but compatibly with the need to have the right degree of modularity.
G. Commercial and public domain packages should be used whenever possible.
H.Existing software packages should be reused wherever possible.
I.Existing software expertise should be consulted whenever possible.
J. All software which does not directly control specific hardware must be written as machine independent, portable code. Even for microprocessor software, the software should be hardware independent, to allow a later choice of the target microprocessors.
 
 
 


	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	



 
 
 


	

	

	

	

ATTRIBUTES
K. To allow for expansion and maintenance, Gemini 8m Telescopes standards must be defined for the on-line software and the development environment.
L. On-line version control must be implemented. That is, the version control system must be available to recover/restore versions at all times.
M. At boot time, the Gemini 8m Telescopes software shall check the consistency of ver- sions of all the various software components.
N. Table-driven software should be used whenever possible, to avoid unnecessary com- pilations.
 
Whether the software is table driven, message driven, or a combination of both is a function of the individual work packages and defined in the appropriate work pack- age description.
 
Changing system constants, such as arcseconds/bit for an encoder, shall not require recompiling but will be updated as part of system startup, and, for some constants, will be modifiable during operation. System status parameters will be maintained to an extent that will allow restarting the system and regaining the previous state. The extent of duplication of the previous state will be dictated by safety and practical con- siderations.
 
Strict checking should be applied on this to preserve maintainability and reconfigura- tion of the system.

A reliability program is part of the Gemini Control System. The requirements for this program and some measures of reliability are detailed below. The plan is as provided by Glen Heriot of the Canadian Gemini Project Office.


	

	

	

	

Reliability is defined as “The duration or probability of failure-free performance under state conditions” or “The probability that an item can perform its intended function for a specified interval under stated conditions”. The [GSR] sets as a requirement 2% and a goal 1% for total system (mechanical, electrical, and software) downtime due to failures - this translates to a maximum of 15 minutes per night or 1 night per month of downtime. This in turn sets quite stringent requirements on both MTBF and MTTR for the software and controls.
 
To guarantee maximum availability of the control system, retry procedures must be embodied in the software in case of error or failure (e.g. time-out, hardware failure) to achieve recovery on-line whenever possible.
 
Should recovery also fail, the error or failure has to be reported in a clear form (to identify the cause of the problem) and the system shall put itself into a safe state, whenever a safety aspect might be involved.
 
To avoid unnecessary downtime, it must be possible for the system to reconfigure itself in order to continue observing, in a different mode if required, given the failure of a single non-critical subsystem.
 
 
 
 
 


	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	



 
 
 


	

	

	

	

ATTRIBUTES
To increase software robustness, range checking and validity checking shall be supported before execution of any input command. This must be possible ahead of time, preparing observing sequences for automatic observations and simulating observations to estimate results.
 
On-line pre-checking of the operational status of equipment should be done prior to send- ing critical or time consuming commands. It must be possible to apply continuous moni- toring to all subsystems on request, both when in operation and when idle, to check their operational status.
 
A measure of fault rates should be done during commissioning to establish baseline rates for system reliability monitoring.
 
There are to be recovery procedures to restart after error failure.
 
The system should be constantly monitoring active subsystems to be sure they are operat- ing correctly before sending command to each subsystem. This monitoring should con- tinue on inactive subsystems.
 
The goal for recover and/or reconfiguration is 5 minutes from onset of the error condition to observing again.
 
Specific requirements are:
A.measurable, realistic reliability needs B.performance criteria for the system C.definition of failure
D. conditions of use and environments
E. means of verification
F. period of time during system life
 


	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

A detailed plan for maintaining and periodically upgrading the Control System over its lifetime will be part of the Gemini Control System. The plan will consider:
A. Maintenance requirements including an estimate of required resources.
B. The method of upgrading the system to add capabilities and performance. Areas where upgrades are anticipated should be identified with an estimate of the required effort and resources.
 
These issues will be addressed in the context of the mountain environment where the sys- tem will be operating. The plan will be delivered with the control system.
 
 


	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	



 
 
 


	

	

	

	

ATTRIBUTES
 
Maintenance of commercial software (Solaris, VxWorks) used by this work package is the responsibility of the WPR and the maintenance costs are not covered by the work package budget.
 
Community software support (EPICS) is available nominally free-of-charge through the normal release and bug-fix procedures used in the community.
 
All subsystem software is to include modules to aid in the maintenance and testing of the subsystem. For example, each subsystem is to include a simulator that provides a reference behavior for that subsystem. Simple mechanisms should exist for replacing a subsystem with its simulation.
 
The following self-check levels are to be supplied with sub-system software:
A. Monitor level. Each subsystem should have a background task running whenever that subsystem is operational, performing such tasks as checking power supply lev- els, temperatures, performance, correct responses to commands. The OCS is to be notified of any detected problems.
B. Self-test level. Each subsystem should provide a module for fully exercising all sub- system components, both hardware and software. This module is executed automati- cally during start-up and on demand through the defined interface. Problems are to be automatically reported to the OCS via the defined interface.
C. System level. There are also software modules for testing the subsystem as an inte- grated portion of the entire system. This software would be executed on demand dur- ing maintenance operation level.

ATTRIBUTES
 
MIL-STD-822B, System Safety Program Requirements, defines safety and risk as:
 
Safety: Freedom from those conditions that can cause death, injury, occupational illness, or damage to or loss of equipment or property
 
Risk: An expression of the possibility of a mishap in terms of hazard severity and hazard probability
 
In addition the Gemini project defines a hazard as:
 
Hazard: Something that could cause death, injury, illness, or damage/loss.


	

	

	

	

The Gemini system must be self-monitoring to invoke safety monitoring to prevent risk to people or damage to equipment. The software should be able to quickly bring the Gemini system to a safe state upon notification of such danger. Subsystems must be able to detect such danger and report it appropriately. In the event that the risk persists, subsystems must be able to move themselves into safe states to protect people and equipment (i.e. if there is a failure in the higher-level systems).
 
Safety protection must be applied whenever there is the risk that the actions of the control software could endanger people or cause damage to any Gemini 8m Telescopes sub- system, for example, by driving beyond limits or by overexposing detectors. This protec- tion, where implemented, must be independent of the software. In general this will require mechanical hard stops, electrical interlocks, electrical hard limit switches, soft limit switches, software limits, and watch dogs,.
 
The order in which these systems will work is as follows:
1.   software limits - the software will not allow unsafe actions; the command will be rejected
2.   soft limit switches - the software will detect unsafe areas and halt; the software will allow movement off of soft limits
3.   software watch dogs - the software will halt if its watch dog has not been reset
4.   hardware watch dogs - the system will halt if its watch dog has not been reset
5.   hard limit switches - these switches will remove power from actuator when beyond soft limits; the software/electrical systems will allow movement off of hard limits
6.   hardware interlocks - these will prevent both software and hardware from action - there will be no bypass of these systems
7.   hard stops - the mechanism cannot move beyond this point due to mechanical limit(s). In general hard stops will use dampers to avoid damage to equiment.
 
 


	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	



 
 
 


	

	

	

	

ATTRIBUTES
The Gemini 8m Telescopes software shall be able to bring the Gemini 8m Telescopes system quickly to a safe state upon detection of danger. Safety aspects shall be ana- lyzed during the functional specification phase of the software.
 
Security must be provided in order to both prevent accidental mix-up of commands from different users on different parts of the system and to prevent intrusion from the wide area network into the Gemini 8m Telescopes. In particular, the astronomical database must be protected from intrusion, whether the purpose is to access private data or to be destructive. It is acceptable, and may well prove to be the best solution, to provide intrusion security by a well designed network gateway acting as a firewall.
 
A system that is operating in Engineering/Maintenance mode must ignore directives from other systems, though status information should still be provided for use by other systems.
 
There should be security preventing the intrusion into the system by unauthorized users, or users at unauthorized access levels.
 
All systems are appropriately interlocked. This interlock must not depend on any software for reliable operation. Details of the interlock system are found in the Mount Control System Work Package Definition.
 
The interlock philosophy is as follows:
• All hazards capable of causing death and/or loss of irreplacable equipment shall be passively interlocked.
• All hazards capable of causing injury and/or severe damage to equipment shall be actively interlocked (severe damage implies that repairs are not repairable at the depot level.
• All other hazards may be interlocked via software.
The precedence for conforming to safety requirements will be:
1.   design for minimum risk
2.   incorporate safety devices
3.   provide warning devices
4.   develop procedures and training
 
The general safety requirements are:
A. eliminate hazards through design, including material selection
B. isolate hazardous substances from people

A Controls Test Plan is part of the Gemini Control System. This plan will address all areas of testing from design, acceptance, commissioning through to hand-over. The objectives and requirements of this plan are detailed below.
 
MIL-STD-1309C, Definitions of terms for Test, Measurement and Diagnostic Equipment, has these definitions:
 
Testability: A design characteristic which allows the status of a unit to be confidently determined in a timely fashion.
 
Built-in-test: An integral capability of the mission equipment which provides an onboard, automated test capability to detect, diagnose, or isolate system failures. The fault detection and, possibly, isolation capability is used for periodic or continuous monitoring of a sys- tem’s operational health, and for observation and, possibly, diagnosis as a prelude to main- tenance action.


	

	

	

	

The major objectives are:
•  test effectively with minimum effort and cost
•  reduce maintenance induced problems
•  reduce the cost of test equipment and programming
•  reduce cost of documentation
 
Since the Gemini software will be developed in stages over a period of years, and since computer technology is expected to evolve rapidly over this same period, the software is to be designed to be easily extended and upgraded with modifications to non-changing components. The software itself, its installation process, and its docu- mentation must be developed with this expandability in mind, using general industry standards.
 


	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

All software is to be developed using typical modularization and standardization techniques. In particular, each module’s environment is strictly defined by its inter- face to other components. No module can rely upon information outside of this inter- face. Module selection should be done in logical fashion to minimize the size of the interfaces between modules.
 
The on-line databases can be considered part of this interface, but are only accessible through their defined interfaces.
 
The software must be strictly modular, i.e. the functionality of a subsystem should correspond to that which belongs to that subsystem and only to that, so that software for different subsystems can be installed and maintained independently of all the rest.
 
 
 
 


	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	



 
 
 


	

	

	

	

LIFE CYCLE ASPECTS
This is needed in particular for multi-instrument operation, for example, as instruments share the same subsystems on the telescope.
 
At the same time, the possibility must exist to acquire information about other parts of the system (for example, telescope coordinates) (as mentioned in the control flow require- ments in Section 3.1.1).
 
It also important that there are no undesired interactions between subsystems. This may be enforced either at the client/server interface or at the message system level.
 


	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

A.  Fault tolerance. The security and safety of the system should be guaranteed even in the event of failure of any component, including the higher-level software.
 
B.  Redundancy. Hardware redundancy is a not requirement of the Gemini systems. How- ever, the ability to reconfigure the software if one actuator fails is desirable. Data redun- dancy is also a requirement, to prevent a single failure from causing the loss of collected data. The goal is to minimize the effects of single-point errors throughout the system.
 


	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

As much as possible, the system is to take advantage of parallel operation to improve effi- ciency. The Telescope Control System should be capable of detecting and invoking paral- lel operation as it is responsible for control of all of the telescope and enclosure subsystems.


	

	

	

	

The Gemini 8m Telescopes software has to be developed according to a structured and formally defined development model. The purpose of this is to:
• make the development process visible (for quality and maintenance reasons)
• avoid incomplete specifications
• discover errors early (via review and audit procedures)
• secure structured, maintainable software
• guarantee software quality
• improve and ease cooperation.
 
This has to be defined in [SMP] and [SCP] (see Applicable Documents, Section 1.3), which will cover:
 
 


	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	



 
 
 


	

	

	

	

DEVELOPMENT ENVIRONMENT
• Development methods
• Formal approval, review and audit procedures
• Documentation
• Coding and debugging
• Simulation
• Component and integration-verification and testing
• Configuration and version management.


	

	

	

	

The development environment for the Gemini 8m Telescopes software consists of the computer hardware and system software (operating system, languages and tools) cho- sen optimally to support the development model presented in the previous section on life-cycle aspects.
 
The choice of such an environment has to be defined, together with the choice of all the Gemini 8m Telescopes standards, but excluding the target computer hardware, in Section 4.2.5 on page 4- 7.
 
The following criteria for later selection shall be kept in mind:
• Emphasis on development and productivity requirements, including cross support tools
• Portability of software (target hardware independence)
• Hardware and vendor independence
• Use of industrial and defacto standards.


	

	

	

	

Test procedure methods have to be defined in the Software Test Plan (STP), while test plans shall be written for all individual software packages and modules comprising the Gemini 8m Telescopes software.
 
Apart from the component and integration test procedures, a formal release system should exist at package and module level, which should be checkable on-line by the operational procedures for consistency. Every system must thus be able to supply its current version upon request.
 
The test operation level has already been discussed in Section 3.2.1 on page 3- 3.

This section presents the specific attributes and requirements for Gemini software.
 
Only the high-level requirements for Gemini software are presented here. Detailed speci- fications for the subsystems are found in the individual chapters of the Software Design Description.


	

	

	

	

 
Regardless of application, the Gemini software exhibits numerous common attributes. These attributes are described in this section.
 


	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

 
The Gemini system maintenance philosophy is described in the Software Management Plan (SMP).
 
Preventative maintenance is scheduled as specified in the Gemini Design Requirements Specification.
 


	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

 
All software is to be developed using typical modularization and standardization tech- niques. In particular, each module's environment is strictly defined by its interface to other components. No module can rely upon information outside of this interface.

OTHER CONTROLS AND SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS
ule selection should be done in logical fashion to minimize the size of the interfaces between modules.
 
The on-line databases can be considered part of this interface, but are only accessible Reliability and availability
 
A measure of fault rates should be done during commissioning to establish baseline rates for system reliability monitoring.
 
There are to be recovery procedures to restart after error failure. See section Section 3.2.5 on page 3 - 5.
 
During science planning, there should be validity and feasibility checks to help ensure effective and efficient use of the telescope. Where appropriate, these checks should also be performed during operation.
 
The system should be constantly monitoring active subsystems to be sure they are operating correctly before sending commands to each subsystem. This monitoring should continue on inactive subsystems.


	

	

	

	

 


	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

 
All telescope and instrument parameters are kept in an on line database to permit easy implementation of table-driven applications. The interface between software control packages is normally done via interface calls to the on-line database.
 
The requirements for this database package are:
A. All telescope, instrument, and detector control information is to be available at any operation level.
B. Access times to the database are to be in the range of 2-3 msec per access. C.Asynchronous writes are to be supported, allowing for concurrent operation. D.Time-access critical information is available in memory.
E.There is to be a consistent and logical (i.e. name based) access method.
F.The database must support both remote access and distributed data.
 
 
 
 
 


	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	



 
 
 


	

	

	

	

OTHER CONTROLS AND SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS
The internal (within the IOC) implementation of this database is to be based on EPICS. The implementation within the host workstation is TBD.
 


	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

 
 
A fundamental criteria of Gemini telescope operation is that it support a full implementa- tion of remote operations. This includes remote observing, remote control of telescope, enclosure, and instruments, multipoint monitoring, remote monitoring, remote access for testing, development, diagnostics, and maintenance,
 
It is expected that all operational capability found in on site operations is extended to remote operations, with some degradation in performance resulting from WAN bandwidth considerations. This means the video data signals must be encoded digitally and trans- ferred via the WAN to remote sites.
 
There must be some form of security to control access to system features, possibly restricting some operations to specific remote sites (e.g. Hale Pohaku or Hilo in Hawaii, Cerro Tololo in Chile, etc.)

Final storage locations for the data types is presented here, along with a description of the different databases that are available.
A.The on-line data store holds astronomical data for the current observation. B.Astronomical data are automatically stored onto the Archive medium (external software). C.Star catalogs are available in Astronomical object catalogs (external software).
D.Telescope and instrument parameters are distributed in databases across the IOCs for those systems. There is also a central repository maintained by the OCS that holds these databases for down-loading to the IOCs.

OTHER CONTROLS AND SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS
E.All additional data that is not required on line (configuration information, detailed documentation, operation logs, etc.) are stored in a relational DBMS. (supported software).


	

	

	

	

 
Input data are all data that are predefined at operation start. This includes catalogs, calibrations and flat fields available in archives, etc.
 
Observing commands (whether entered interactively or via the Sequencer) are input data that provide information on the course of operation and trigger events.


	

	

	

	

 
Replies to commands, including status information, updates to parameters, video and astronomical information are considered data outputs.
 
These data end up in the different databases.
 
Operational information, such as logging messages, alarms, and errors are special forms of output data, since they are made available for later inspection and debug- ging.


	

	

	

	

 
One criteria is that sufficient information be recorded during an observation to recre- ate the sequence of events that occurred during the observation. This requires that all input and output data be logged appropriately.
 
Given an initial set of configuration parameters, the Gemini system operates via a sequence of commands. This operation is complemented by using previously stored data, calibrations, and star catalogs
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 


	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	



 
 
 


	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

OTHER CONTROLS AND SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS
 
 
A. Automatic operation. This is the normal mode of operation. The observation is per- formed through a preplanned program requiring little or no interaction with the observer.
B. Interactive operation. Science planning and program changes are accomplished through interactive operation. Is is possible to enter interactive operation from automatic operation to handle exceptional conditions.
This is the normal mode of operation at maintenance and test levels.
C. Modes and control. Normal operation is possible at all operation levels (observing, maintenance, and test) and applies to the following conditions (where appropriate) on any subsystem:
1.      Observing
2.      Stand-by
3.      Maintenance and testing
D. Performance. Overall performance of the Gemini telescope is defined as the percentage of viewable time during which exposures have been taken (i.e. sum of all exposure times over available time for exposures).
To improve this performance, all possible concurrencies in system operation should be used. Best use of concurrency occurs when using the Sequencer.
E. Start-up and shut-down. There are start-up and shut-down procedures that must exist at many different levels:
1.    Cold start-up, starting the system from scratch (including time to download all software) should take about 5 minutes. This does not include time to start-up the telescope or instru- ments.
2.    
Warm start-up, starting from scratch but also excluding software download time should take about 1 minute.
3.     Telescope start-up, measured from end of cold or warm start-up should be about 4 min- utes.
4.     Instrument start-up, measured from end of telescope start-up, should take 2 minutes or less.
There must be a way to shut down all subsystems (hardware and software).

OTHER CONTROLS AND SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS
1. System logging information should include all important events, properly time- stamped and indexed. The goal is to be able to recreate the steps in a observation from the system logs.
G.
Engineering Logging
1.    It must be possible to log engineering data at up to 200 Hz rates for short periods of time. This data must be available to external software packages for analysis.
2.     Long-term logging of engineering data must be possible at slower (1 Hz or less) rates, into a common format (baselined as SYBASE).


	

	

	

	

A. Fault-tolerance and recovery. See Attributes, Section 4.1 on page 4 - 1.
B.
Error logging. All errors should be reported using a common, system-wide proce- dure.
 
There are three types of errors:
1.   Fatal. Fatal errors occur if there is no acceptable recovery procedure that will allow operation to proceed. Under fatal error conditions, the system falls back to a safe "backup" state requiring human intervention for restart.
2.   Serious. Under serious errors, the system does not need to move off-line, but the cur- rent operation cannot be completed. Serious errors require human intervention to restart full operation.
3.   Warning. All other unexpected conditions result in warnings that are properly logged. The system continues operation, though perhaps with reduced efficiency.
 
All subsystems must group errors into these categories. In addition, errors that result in an "alarm" should be described, along with the proper action required to acknowl- edge and eliminate the alarm condition.
 
Besides the time-stamp, error logging should provide enough information to trace the condition back to its apparent source, both in equipment and in event sequence.
 
There should be tools available to extract error (and other) logging information by subsystem component, time- sequence, previous events, and so on.
 
The Gemini Control System formally distinguishes alarms from errors. Errors result from failures to successfully complete commands, while alarms represent asynchro- nous failures. Note that an error may result in an alarm.
 
 
 
 
 


	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	



 
 
 


	

	

	

	

OTHER CONTROLS AND SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS
There are two types of alarm conditions. The first are automatically monitored alarms, which exist as long as the errors persist and are then automatically cleared. The second type of alarm require human acknowledgment to clear.
C. Recovery. In addition to start-up procedures, there must be well-defined recovery proce- dures for any subsystem that has become inoperative.
 
Command retries must be included in the system for most common timeouts or no- response conditions. These retries should occur automatically in the command handling to avoid unnecessary error conditions.
D. Performance. The performance of error-mode recovery is specific to the subsystem and is defined in the Functional specification for that subsystem.
•
Normally, there is no recovery possible from a fatal error except to shut-down and then restart the subsystem. However, in the case of an instrument failure, it may be possi- ble to continue operation by rescheduling to use observations that do not require that particular instrument.
• For serious errors, it may be possible to continue operation with degraded performance. For example, failure of automatic tracking may require manual tracking; other errors may result in operation with a different instrument.
•
Under normal conditions, the number of warnings should be small. The system should monitor the rate of warning messages since an increase might indicate that some tun- ing or maintenance is appropriate. Ideally, such conditions should be noted by the subsystems before reaching the OCS level.
• Failure conditions should not cascade. That is, failure of one subsystem should not affect other, working, subsystems, including communication links.
 


	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

 
Given the size of the Gemini system and its long expected lifetime, it is important that standards are provided for system design and development.


	

	

	

	

 
 
All Gemini supported software is to be developed using a formally defined model. The Ward/Mellor approach to developing real-time systems is used and covers:

Functional analysis is done using a CASE tool suitable for use with Ward/Mellor techniques, such as TSEE, by Westmount Technologies.
 
The design is to use the techniques and diagrams introduced by Ward and Mellor and reviewed by the Gemini staff.
 
Detailed design and development standards are not specified, but expected to con- form to system goals and established practice.
 
An object-oriented approach is encouraged but not required.


	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

 
The upper levels (User-interface and OCS) are assumed to not require a real-time operating environment. However, the operating environment at these levels is expected to provide sufficient performance for both human interaction and communi- cations.
 
Real-time support is required at the IOC level.
A. Development system software. The choice for a development environment is based on the following criteria:
• Productivity and development tools
• Software portability and hardware independence
• Vendor independence
• Industry and de-facto standards
• Support for state-of-the-art user interfaces
• Support of a distributed environment
 
Given these criteria, the following recommendations exist.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 


	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	



 
 
 


	

	

	

	

OTHER CONTROLS AND SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS
1.          The development operating system is UNIX System V, Release 4, using only POSIX compliant calls to the operating system. In particular, vendor specific extensions are not permitted. Compliance to POSIX is measured against the book: POSIX Programmer’s Guide - Writing Portable UNIX Programs, by Donald Lewine, O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. 1991.
2.           
Any special needs that cannot be acceptably met by the available operating system calls are to be discussed with the GPO on a case-by-case basis.
3.            Some packages (such as GUI interfaces and database interfaces) have higher portability requirements that may require the specification of higher level interfaces to the OS.
4.           
The GUI systems are to use X-windows, version 11, release 5 (X11R5) or release 6 (X11R6). The principle language for developing GUIs is Tcl/Tk.
5.            The GNU software tool suite should be used where possible.
6.           
Imake is recommended, with GNU’s autoconfigure utility an acceptable alternative.
7.            CVS is the recommended version control system.
B. IOC and cross-development system software. A number of real-time operating systems were examined for compatibility with the goals for the Gemini Project. At the same time, the availability of cross-support development environments was considered.
 
The recommendations are:
1.         The IOCs will use the real-time operating system VxWorks (from Wind River Systems).
2.         
The communication interface between the IOCs and Unix workstations is to be IMP.
3.     It is assumed that all IOC software is to be developed on Unix workstations in a win- dowed development environment.
4.     The cross-compiler to be used for IOC software development is one specified by the Gem- ini Project. It is the GNU cc compiler as furnished with VxWorks.
5.       IOC software development is to be done using a common development environment, as specified in the Software Programming Standards (SPS)
C.
Software below the IOC level. There is likely to be software below the IOC level, but it should not require downloading, except possibly for upgrades, typically being placed into ROM or FLASH memory.
 
Any access to this embedded software while it is connected to the system is strictly through software in the IOC. From outside the IOC this software appears as part of the electronics.
 
Although this software is not considered part of the Gemini software, it is obviously an advantage (for maintenance purposes) to have it conform to the requirements of Gemini software.

The computer hardware used for development must conform to the following:
A. Workstations must match specified software standards and present a well-designed devel- opment environment, including cross-support for VxWorks development, if needed.
B. Workstations are expected to be state-of-the-art systems (CPU, communications support) in a scaleable family. This allows the migration of development systems to advancing technology.

The following recommendations are made:
A. Workstations.
1.   
Where Gemini is providing the computer equipment as part of a contractual agree- ment, the developmental workstations are to be SUN SPARC-10 (model 41) or SPARC Classic with 64MB of dynamic memory.
2.     Internal Gemini software development is done in a multi-platform environment, enabling final selection of target machines to be made based on experiences with development equipment.
B. Peripherals
1.          Workstations are to have at least 2GB of disk.
2.      DDS DAT cartridges are to be available for data acquisition on development sys- tems, backups, and possibly for software transport (Internet is the preferred means of transport).
3.          A CD-ROM is needed for SUN OS and software upgrades.
4.      Any compression on a transport medium is to be done using a standard commonly available algorithm and archives are to be in tar format
C. IOCs.
1.    Where Gemini is providing the IOC CPU as part of a contractual agreement, the development systems are to be Motorola MVME-167B (68040@33MHz) with at least 16MB of dynamic memory.
2.     The IOC computer cards for development work are defined in the ICS work package description.
3.     The target IOC computer cards are not to be established until as late as possible, to take advantage of technology advances while staying compatible with the develop- ment systems. A baseline system is included as part of the ICS work package.

OTHER CONTROLS AND SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS
 
 
There are places in the Gemini system where software exists below the IOC level that is interfaced to IOC software. The standards for this interface is not part of this specifica- tion. The use of this software is to be explained and discussed on a case-by-case basis.
 
In cases where there is a distributed network of target microprocessors involved at this level, it is appropriate to provide a standard sub-network. This type of Fieldbus is to be implemented using an ALAN/BRADLEY bus, ProfiBus, or other approved Fieldbus.
 
In cases where there is a distributed set of commercial equipment to be controlled the rec- ommended method is to use an ALAN/BRADLEY system to control the equipment man- ually and interface to it using RS-422 or similar connection to an IOC.


	

	

	

	

 
All communication hardware must meet the data flow requirements and software proto- cols defined in this document. The following recommendations are based on currently available technology. It is entirely appropriate that changes will be made to take advan- tages of changes to that technology.
A. The control LAN is based on Ethernet IEEE 802.3.
B.
The Time distribution systems are described in the Software Design Description..
C. The detector LAN is also based on Ethernet, at least for the development systems. A solution meeting the performance requirements of the final system is to be decided later.
D. The backbone LAN cannot be Ethernet because of bandwidth requirements. A FDDI system is recommended for the backbone LAN.
E.
Cabling of LANs is shown in Figure 4 - 1. Also shown are cabling requirements to the base facility. Requirements for cabling are given in the Electronic Design Specification.
F. Interlock connections must be provided for all critical subsystems. The software inter- face to the interlock system is defined in the Instrument Control System Infrastructure Work Package Definition.

USER REQUIREMENTS FOR EPICS DEVELOPERS
 
 
Wherever possible, Gemini software is to take advantage of existing software. However, all existing software is to be evaluated in terms of the specifications given here. This helps reduce life-cycle costs and maintenance efforts.
 


	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

 
Life cycle constraints are discussed in the Gemini Software Management Plan.


	

	

	

	

 
The Experimental Physics and Industrial Control System (EPICS) toolkit is the foundation of the Gemini control system. EPICS was originally developed at the Los Alamos and Argonne National Laboratories for use in large accelerator control and diagnostics sys- tems. It is now an established standard within the international High Energy Physics com- munity and is gaining acceptance amongst astronomical sites.
 
Within the EPICS community there is understood to be an informal distinction between two classes of developers, labeled ‘Internals’ and ‘Applications’. Although these defini- tions are nowhere written down, this understanding serves as the basis for many discus- sions with the community and for the nature of training classes.
 


	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

 
Note: The bulk of this section is taken from the EPICS document ‘EPICS Overview’.
 
EPICS consists of a set of hardware and software components from which a control sys- tem can be created.


	

	

	

	

•  OPI        Operator Interface.
This is a UNIX based workstation which can run various EPICS tools.
•  IOC Input Output Controller.
This is VME/VXI based chassis containing a Motorola 68xxx processor, various I/O modules, and VME modules that provide access to other I/O buses such as GPIB.
•  LAN Local area network.
 
 


	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	



 
 
 


	

	

	

	

USER REQUIREMENTS FOR EPICS DEVELOPERS
This is the communication network which allows the IOCs and OPIs to commu- nicate. EPICS provides a software component, Channel Access, which provides network transparent communication between a Channel Access client and an arbi- trary number of Channel Access servers.


	

	

	

	

 
 
Database
 
The heart of an IOC is a memory resident database together with various memory resident structures describing the contents of the database. EPICS supports a large and extensible set of record types, e.g. ai (Analog Input), ao (Analog Output), etc.
 
Each record type has a fixed set of fields. Some fields are common to all record types and others are specific to particular record types. Every record has a record name and every field has a field name. The first field of every database record holds the record name, which must be unique across all IOCs attached to the same TCP/IP subnet.
 
A number of data structures are provided so that the database can be accessed effi- ciently. Most software components, because they access the database via database access routines, do not need to be aware of these structures.
 
Database Access
 
With the exception of record and device support, all access to the database is via the channel or database access routines.
 
Database Scanning
 
Database scanning is the mechanism for deciding when to process a record. Four types of scanning are possible: Periodic, Event, I/O Event, and Passive.
 
Periodic: A request can be made to process a record periodically. A number of time intervals are supported.
 
Event: Event scanning is based on the posting of an event by any IOC software component. The actual subroutine call is: post_event(event_num)
 
I/O Event: The I/O event scanning system processes records based on external interrupts. An IOC device driver interrupt routine must be available to accept the external interrupts.
 
 
 


	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	



 
 
 


	

	

	

	

USER REQUIREMENTS FOR EPICS DEVELOPERS
Passive: Passive records are processed as a result of linked records being processed or as a result of external changes such as channel access puts.
 
Record Support, Device Support, and Device Drivers
 
In order to remove record specific knowledge from database access, each record type has an associated record support module. Similarly, in order to remove device specific knowl- edge from record support, each record type can have a set of device support modules. If the method of accessing hardware is complicated, a device driver can be provided to shield the device support modules. Many record types, in particular all types not associ- ated with hardware, do not have device support or drivers.
 
The IOC software is designed so that the database access layer knows nothing about the record support layer other than how to call it. The record support layer in turn knows noth- ing about it’s device support layer other than how to call it. Similarly the only thing a device support layer knows about it’s associated driver is how to call it. This design allows a particular installation and even a particular IOC within an installation to choose the set of record types, device types, and drivers it wishes to use. The remainder of the IOC sys- tem software is unaffected.
 
Every record support module must provide a record processing routine. It is this routine that is called by the database scanners. Record processing consists of some combination of a standard set of functions.
 
Database Monitors
 
The routines described in this section provide a callback mechanism for database value changes. This allows the caller to be notified when database values change without con- stantly polling the database. A mask can be set to specify value changes, alarm state changes, and/or archive changes.
 
At the present time only channel access uses database monitors. No other software should use the database monitors. Because they are of interest only to channel access, the monitor routines will not be described.


	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

 
Channel access provides network transparent access to IOC databases. It is based on a cli- ent-server model. Each IOC provides a channel access server which is willing to establish communication with an arbitrary number of clients. Channel access client services are available on both OPIs and IOCs. A client can communicate with an arbitrary number of servers.
 
It should be noted that channel access does not provide access to database records as records. This is a deliberate design decision. This allows new record types to be added

EPICS provides a number of OPI based tools. These can be divided into two groups based on whether or not they use channel access. Channel access tools are real time tools, i.e. they are used to monitor and control IOCs.
 
Channel Access Tools
•  MEDM
Motif version of combined display manager and display editor.
•  DM Display Manager.
This tool reads one or more display list files created by EDD, establishes commu- nication with all necessary IOCs, establishes monitors on process variables, accepts operator control requests, and updates the display to reflect all changes.
•  ALH Alarm Handler.
This is a general purpose alarm handler driven by an alarm configuration file.
•  AR Archiver.
This is a general purpose tool to acquire and save data from IOCs.
•   Sequencer
A tool which runs in an IOC or OPI and emulates a finite state machine.
•  Other OPI CA clients
It is possible to interface preexisting software systems to the channel access library. This has been done for several commercial packages including IDL/ PvWave, Mathematica, and WINGZ to allow access and manipulation of EPICS process variables by these applications.
 
Other OPI Tools
•  DCT Database Configuration Tool.

EPICS consists of a set of core software and a set of optional components. The core soft- ware, i.e. the components of EPICS without which EPICS would not function, are:
•  Channel Access - Client and Server software
•  Database
•  Scanners
•  Monitors
•  DCT
•  Build Tools
•  Source/Release
All other software components are optional. Of course any application developer would be crazy to ignore tools such as MEDM (or EDD/DM). Likewise an application developer would not start from scratch developing record and device support. Most OPI tools do not, however, have to be used. Likewise any given record support module, device support module, or driver could be deleted from a particular IOC and EPICS will still function.

USER REQUIREMENTS FOR EPICS DEVELOPERS
The details of the EPICS work required can be broken down into several broad cate- gories which reflect the nature of the various work packages. This breakdown is given in the following subsections:


	

	

	

	

•  Channel Access - Client and Server Software, Scanners, Monitors Gemini will not modify the heart of EPICS. We leave this to Los Alamos.
•  Host-based Development Tools (CAPFAST, EDD, etc.) Neither will Gemini plan on creating new development tools.


	

	

	

	

•  Record Support, Device Support, and Device Drivers For Gemini this entails support for new devices: PMAC, VMIC5578, BANCOMM


	

	

	

	

•  Other OPI CA Clients
The OCS may need a CA client that implements the OCS Attribute/Value proto- col.
The DHS may need a CA client that gathers logging information. This could be an EPICS AR (or AR_cmd) task.


	

	

	

	

•  IOC Database
•  IOC SNC programs
•  Files associated with OPI Channel Access Tools
These would include MEDM .adl display definition files, PvWave/IDL scripts, AR request files, ALH alarm configuration files, and the like.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 


	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	



 
 
 


	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

USER REQUIREMENTS FOR EPICS DEVELOPERS
 
 
For the purposes of work performed for the Gemini 8-m Telescopes Project the following definitions will be used to differentiate between the two flavors of EPICS development work:
 
Internals work would include any of the following:
•  Channel Access - Client and Server Software, Scanners, Monitors
•  Record Support, Device Support, and Device Drivers
•  Host-based Development Tools (CAPFAST, EDD, etc.)
•  Other OPI CA Clients
The first two items would be suitable topics for an advanced EPICS course on EPICS System Development. The latter two items would be covered under Advanced Applica- tion Development and a case can probably be made that they constitute a category unto themselves which should be labeled something like ‘Internals - Tools’
 
Applications work would then include any of:
•  IOC Database
•  IOC or OPI SNC programs
•  Files associated with OPI Channel Access Tools
These are all topics that would be covered in an EPICS Basics, Building and Using Applications course.
 


	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

 
For each class of developer a specific set of skills is required. The following sections list those that would be commonly used.


	

	

	

	

•  Knowledge of VME and other I/O electronics
•  EPICS Database design techniques
•  SNC programming
•  Use of standard EPICS OPI tools

The experience of the High Energy Physics community is that only a core group of Internals developers is required for maintenance and enhancement of EPICS IOC software and of the standard development and CA client tool set. Specifically, the IOC core software is almost exclusively in the domain of the Los Alamos AOT-8 office.
 
Two major flavors of development tools are in use with support coming from key groups within Los Alamos and Argonne.
 
Many sites contribute custom CA client tools as this generally involves C or C++ programming under a UNIX O/S to interface to the standard CA library.
 
In addition, many sites create their own database record types and new device support and driver layers.
 
Although there is presently a large amount of activity in the enhancement of EPICS Internals software especially in the fields of non-IOC core software, this is an order of magnitude less than the amount of Applications work under way at over 20 distinct programs.


	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

 
Another large group of predominately Applications developers that are starting work are the Collaborative Access Teams (CATS) at Argonne’s Advanced Photon Source (APS).
 
 
 
 


	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	



 
 
 


	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

USER REQUIREMENTS FOR EPICS DEVELOPERS
The APS is a facility to produce high brilliance X-rays for a variety of experiments and includes 36 experimental halls with 2 lines each. As of March 1994, there were 15 CATS at the APS with most CATS responsible for a single sector (2 beamlines). Each CAT has its own funding for designing/building/operating the physical beamline, instrumentation, controls, and data acquisition systems.
 
Because the experimental areas must be coordinated with the main facility control system and since 25% of the beamtime must be made available to independent investigators it was strongly recommended that EPICS be used as the toolkit for all CATS development work. Not only would this simplify the integration with the central control system but would also provide a common environment for facility visitors.
 
Typically, each CAT has 1 or 2 developers, and the major focus is not on the IOC software although some new records, like the Multichannel Analyser, have been created, but rather on the OPI CA client applications. Heavy use is being made of both Tcl/TK and IDL to support high-level sequencing and data reduction. This is similar to the Gemini architec- ture as the bulk of the control system intelligence is contained within OPI CA client tasks.
 
Other items of concern are:
•  Different science programs in use at each CAT which have complex associated data acquisition and reduction routines.
•  The creation of large data sets.
•  Simultaneous local and remote monitoring and intervention.
•  Ease of use for one-time users.
•  Data export to home institutions.


	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

 
 
The Standard Instrument Controller work package is tasked with laying the Internals ground work for all other Gemini control system work packages. In this project, the only required IOC-based Internals work is the creation of record, device, and driver support for three VME I/O cards. It is anticipated that all other IOC-related work packages will be performing exclusively Applications work.
 
In the advent of future work packages requiring Internals work it is planned the RGO SIC development staff will be made available. In this way the number of Internals staff is kept at a minimum.

There are several means of transmitting commands and data across the Gemini system:
A.Direct: A command source may directly specify the target subsystem. This is the most common means of command transfer from the Observatory Control System to the sub- systems.
B.Channel: Commands and data may be routed through a channel. This mechanism requires that some (unknown to the source) target subsystem has been attached to the channel as the target. It is possible that the channel is 'intelligent', in the sense that data may be converted from one form to another during transmission. This might be imple- mented by connecting two channels with a conversion module. An example of a channel connection might be the data stream between the A&G system and the Primary Mirror Control System. The A&G might be transmitting Zernickes to the PMCS, which is receiv- ing Shack-Hartmann data. The intelligent channel would be responsible for the conver- sion. It is possible that a channel have multiple sources, multiple targets, or both! Finally, a channel might use a separate physical route, to prevent large data transmissions (say) from interfering with the 'normal' command streams.
C.Broadcast: Some commands and data signals are simply broadcast across the control sys- tem. Any subsystem may examine these communications and respond or ignore as appro- priate. For example, the OCS might broadcast a RunTest command, causing all subsystems to perform self-testing. As another example, a critical system failure might cause a ShutDown command to be broadcast.
 
 
 
 
 


	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	



 
 


	

	

	

	

COMMAND STRUCTURE
 
All commands contain the same general structure:
Identification: Command_ID Source
Target
The Command_ID is an identification that is unique to that specific instance of each command. A portion of the ID is monotonically increasing and functions as a time- stamp for journalling and tracing. This is to be implemented using a technique analo- gous to the CFHT odometer.
 
The Source and Target fields indicate the originator and the recipient for the com- mand, as expected. The Target may be a specific recipient, a Channel, or simply a Broadcast, but the Source is always the origination point of the command.
Instruction:
Opcode Parameter set
The remainder of the command provides the body of the command. The Parameter list structure is dependent on the Opcode.


	

	

	

	

This section presents the “generic” commands that all Gemini systems must respond to. There are also “Control Commands” common to all Gemini systems to provide specific functionality during observing. These control commands are presented in the Gemini Software Design Description. Specific commands are presented in the Soft- ware Design Descriptions for the individual subsystems.
 


	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

The following commands are “status” queries used to obtain information about the state of the subsystem.
 
GetVersion The subsystem returns its version identification as a string value.
 
GetStatus The subsystem reports its current status as one of:
 
• DOWN - the subsystem is not operational
• BOOTED - the subsystem has been booted, but not yet configured
• CONFIGURING - the system is in the process of configuring (Steven).
• CONFIGURED - the subsystem is configured, but not yet initialized
• INITIALIZING - the subsystem is doing initialization actions
• RUNNING - the subsystem is running at observing level
• MAINTENANCE - the subsystem is running at maintenance level
• SIMULATION - the subsystem is running in simulation mode
• DISABLED - the subsystem is functional, but has been commanded to ignore control commands
• SHUTDOWN - the subsystem is in the process of shutting down
• LOCKED - an interlock exists on this subsystem.
 
GetState The internal state of the subsystem is returned as one of:
• READY - the subsystem is fully operational, but currently idle.
• BUSY_ON command - the subsystem is working, and currently processing the indicated command.
• NOT_READY - the subsystem is not responding to commands at this time. A GetStatus command can be used to determine the current status.
 
GetID The subsystem reports its unique identification tag.
 
GetConfiguration Detailed configuration information is provided. This configuration information includes details of any settings internal configurations (filters, positions, etc.) and, if requested, the detailed results of any self-tests.
 


	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

The following commands affect the behavior of a subsystem independently of the specific task of that subsystem.
 
SetStatus The target subsystem is to enter the state associated with the specified status argument. For example, SetStatus SIMULATION causes the targeted subsystem(s) to enter simulation mode. Setting the status to SHUTDOWN disables a subsystem. Not all status levels are reachable through SetStatus.
 
SetConfiguration This command directs the downloading of a configuration from the host to the target subsystem. It is important that care be taken to avoid configura- tion values that would result in motion, etc. This command can operate with the Get- Configuration command given above to provide 'sequencing points' for subsystem restarts or roll backs.
 
RunTest The subsystem runs a self-test and reports the result as one of:
• OK - the subsystem has detected no problems, it is running within specifications
• BAD - the subsystem has detected problems that prevent its successful operation
• WARNING - the subsystem has detected a problem that may prevent it from operat- ing to full specification, but does not prevent it from functioning at this time
There may be an argument describing a particular self-test to run. The individual self- tests are specific to the subsystem and are given in the appropriate Work Package Description. Detailed results of self-tests are available through the GetConfiguration command.
 
SetLogging Logging by the indicated subsystem is set to occur at the specified level.
 


	

	

	

	

Communication of information is similar across all systems in the Gemini controls network. Instances of this communication is via routes, which may be direct chan- nels, intelligent channels, or broadcasts. Communication via a route is typically asyn- chronous, with commands available to establish synchronization as needed.
 
OpenRoute A route of the indicated class is being established for some item. The command includes sufficient information on the route to permit the IOC to communi- cate through the route. The 'route' may be a specific subsystem, channel, or broadcast.
 
CloseRoute A previously-opened route is being closed. Modules at either end of the channel are notified and take appropriate action.
 
ResetRoute The route is to be reinitialized. Modules receiving this command are to flush buffers associated with this route and reset operating parameters to initial condi- tions.
 
TestRoute A test message is transmitted across the route. All receivers on the route are to respond with an identification.
 
AwaitItem The module sending this command is blocked until information is received via the indicated route, or a timeout occurs.
 
SetCallback A callback is established to process data across the indicated route.
 
ClearCallback A previously established callback is removed.


	

	

	

	

The following commands are common to all IOC-based subsystems. (Most control sub- systems are IOC-based.) These commands are processed by the IOC subsystem.
 


	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

IOC crates in the Gemini system have local databases. Under the Gemini control system, it is expected that the majority of subsystem control is accomplished through these data- bases. The following commands provide access to those databases.
 
LocateItem If the IOC local database contains the requested item, it responds with an identification sufficient for establishing a route to that item. The LocateItem may be broadcast through the IOC network.
 
GetValue The value of the specified item is obtained.
 
PutValue A value is transmitted for the specified item.
 
StartStream A stream of data is transmitted through the indicated route. The IOC system continues to transmit data values until a StopStream command is received.
 
StopStream The indicated data stream is terminated.
 
SetEvent An event is established as a monitor of some database entry. Appropriate changes to that entry are to result in the indicated event being transmitted.
 
ClearEvent A previously set event is terminated.
 


	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

Time synchronization is commonly required among control subsystems. These commands are to permit appropriate time synchronizations. Times will be provided in IRIG-B format as UTC.


 
Some subsystems may need to obtain information from other systems within the Gemini control system. This access is accomplished using the same communication and database access commands as given above.


	

	

	

	

Within the OCS, all commands are represented as ASCII strings. Fields within the command are labelled and nesting is permitted using braces ({ , }). For example, a typical command might be:
Details of the implementation are the province of the OCS work package developers, who are responsible for providing procedures for constructing/deconstructing/routing command strings. The mappings of specific IOC commands between ASCII strings and EPICS channel access calls are determined by the individual IOC subsystem developers. Work Package Descriptions include baseline command descriptions that need to be implemented for that specific work package.
 
1.0  Introduction
 
The following subsections of Section 1.0 provide an overview of the entire Software Requirements Specification.
 
1.1  Purpose
 
This Software Requirements Specification (SRS) specifies the qualification requirements for The Energy Management System (THEMAS). It provides a technical description of all so ftware requirements of the system, provides traceability of software capability requirements to the Statement of Work, and identifies external interfaces. This document is intended for use by the Design Requirements team, Principle Software Architect, and other parties interested in the development and progression of THEMAS.
 
1.2  Scope
 
The scope of this document is confined to only the software requirements for the THEMAS system. Only those conditions expressed with the imperative "shall" are to be interp reted as binding requirements for this SRS. This document provides a detailed definition of all requirements for the THEMAS system.

1.0  Overview
 
This document is prepared in accordance with the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) / Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) Guide to Software Requirements Specifications, ANSI/IEEE STD 830 -1984. Section 2.0 of this document gives a general description of the THEMAS system. I t provides product perspectives, product functions, user characteristics, general constraints, and assumptions and dependencies of the system. Section 3.0 contains all the details the Design Requirements team needs to create a design. It will contain functional and performance requirements, design constraints, attributes and external interface requirements for the THEMAS system.
2.0  General Description
 
This section of this SRS describes the general factors that effect the THEMAS system and its requirements.                                                                  This section does not state specific requirements, it only makes these requirements easier understood.
 
2.1  Product Perspective
 
The THEMAS system is a system that operates independent of any other system, or any components of the heating and cooling system to which it is attached.                  The THEMAS system, however, is composed mainly of a hardware and software portion.           This SRS only specifies the requirements dealing with the software portion of the system.                          If assumptions or dependencies about the hardware were made, they are stated in this section of the SRS.
 
2.2  Product Functions
 
The THEMAS system is divided into four major sections:                           Monitor Temperature, Determine Utilization, Initialize System, and System Reports.                        All four sections have an associated software configuration item;                     all except the System Reports have an associated hardware configuration item.                                                  The hardware requirements are contained in the system specification.                            The functions of the software for the system are contained in the following paragraphs.
 
2.2.1  Monitor Temperature
 
The monitor temperature function receives the valid temperature and system parameters.                                       The function then goes through the process of determining temperature status. After this process is done, either temperature limit is exceeded or the temperature change is requested.        If the temperature change is requested, then the determine heating /cooling mode process is activated and makes a heating/cooling request.              Some other processes that help the monitor temperature function are:               validate temperature, change thermostat setting, generate alarm, and system initialization.
 
2.2.2  Determine Utilization
 
The determine utilization function receives the heating/cooling request and utilization parameters.                             The function then processes the status of all heating/cooling units and sends out either unit unavailable or heating/cooling unit needed.                                             The fun ction generates either a unit unavailable event which goes into the System Reports function or it generates a heating/cooling signal to turn on/off the units.             The Monitor Temperature and Initialize


 
System functions help the determine utilization to do its processes.
 
2.2.3  Initialize System
 
The initialize system function receives the initialization data for the THEMAS system. The processes that are associated with it are:                        load heating/cooling unit definitions, turn off all heating/cooling units, load th ermostat definitions, load utilization parameters, set trigger values, set overtemperature values, and establish valid temperature range.   The outgoing information that starts the entire THEMAS system is:                         clear all heating/cooling signals, send thermostat definitions, send utilization parameters, send trigger values, send overtemperature values, and send valid temperature range.
 
2.2.4  System Reports
 
The system reports function receives event data from the THEMAS system.                         This function is a database that stores all the events in the THEMAS system.                           This function is mainly for the use of the supervisor of the THEMAS system to maintain an efficient
heating and cooling system.                       The only process that interacts with the system reports function is the generate event data process.
2.3  User Characteristics
 
This system is intended to be used by people that maintain the heating and cooling systems in a building.                          The system should not need intervention from outside users other than the supervisor to maintain operation of THEMAS.                                                      The system should provide warnings to the supervisor about faulty temperatures.                               The displaying  of the current status of the system to the supervisor should not contain excessive information which could confuse the supervisor. The system should provide information in the form of reports to the supervisor so that the system can be run efficiently.
 
2.4  General Constraints
 
The general constraints of the THEMAS system focus on the functionality provided by the external devices connected to i t. The thermostats shall only provide temperature values and temperature settings.  The heating and cooling units provide no feedback to the THEMAS system.           When a signal is sent to a heating or cooling unit, no signal shall be available to allow the THEMAS system to determine if the signal sent to the unit was realized by the unit.
 
2.5  Assumptions and Dependencies


 
In developing the requirements for the THEMAS system, several assumptions have been made about the thermostat hardware and the heating/cooling hardware.                                                  These assumptions are stated in the following paragraphs.
 
2.5.1  Operating System Assumptions
 
The THEMAS system shall be designed to run on the Microsoft ® Windows NT™ operating system.                                   All the internal process communications shall be designed to operate on this operating system.                         Any communication with the thermostats and heating and cooling units shall be done through the interface to these units. These interfaces shall run on this operating system as well.
 
2.5.2  Thermostat Hardware Assump tions
 
It is assumed that the thermostat is capable of returning the current temperature and the current desired temperature setting to the THEMAS system.                                            The thermostat is constantly returning these values with no real time delay in between the thermostat and the THEMAS system.                                              The thermostat also has the capability of being set and controlled by a user of the THEMAS system.
All data sent by the thermostat is in the correct format for the THEMAS system to use.
2.5.3  Heating/Cooling Hardware Assumptions
 
It is assumed that the heating/cooling unit is incapable of returning its current off/on status to the THEMAS system.               The heating/cooling unit has no real time delay when sending these statuses to the THEMAS system.                                                                 The heating/cooling unit shall have the capability of being turned off and on by the supervisor of the THEMAS system.

3.1.2.2  Inputs Operational Parameters
 
3.1.2.3  Processing
This process shall first determine a known state of all the heating and cooling units by issuing a request to turn off all the units.                                      It shall then read the current temperature values and current temperature settings of each thermostat.             If the settings reflect a need for a heating or cooling unit to be turned o n, the process shall issue a request to turn on the appropriate unit.
This determination shall be made in accordance with the rules outlined in section 3.1.4.1 and 3.1.4.2.


 
3.1.2.4  Outputs H/C Request
3.1.3  Validate Temperature (SRS -008)
3.1.3.1  Introduction
The THEMAS system shall only respond to temperatures from the thermostats that are within the specified valid range.
 
3.1.3.2  Inputs Operational Parameters Temperature Data
 
3.1.3.3  Processing
Two types of temperature data shall be recognized from th e thermostats: 1) the temperature setting and 2) the current temperature.                                    This module shall process both types of data.
 
A current temperature value that is received from an individual thermostat shall be compared to the valid temperature range values.  If the current temperature value is strictly less than the lower value of the valid temperature range or if the received temperature value is strictly greater than the upper value of the valid temperature range, then the THEMAS system shall identify the current temperature value as an invalid temperature and shall output an invalid temperature status.                                                             Otherwise, the THEMAS system shall output a valid temperature status.
 
A temperature setting value that is received from an individual thermostat shall be compared to the valid temperature range values.                             If the temperature setting value is strictly less than the lower value of the valid temperature range or if the temperature setting value is strictly greater than the upper value of the valid temperature range, then the THEMAS system shall identify the temperature setting as an invalid temperature and shall output an invalid temperature status.                                                       Otherwise, the THEMAS system shall realize the value for that thermostat’s temperature setting.

3.1.4  Monitor Temperature
The following sections describe the Monitor Temperature component of the THEMAS system.
 
3.1.4.1  Determine Temperature Status (SRS -009)
 
3.1.4.1.1  Introduction
The THEMAS system shall determine wh en a reported temperature or a changed temperature setting exceeds the limits set by the


 
overtemperature values.                    Temperatures that exceed the overtemperature limits shall be reported as such.                                                              Temperatures that do not exceed these limits shall be output for subsequent processing.
 
3.1.4.1.2  Inputs Valid Temperatures Trigger Values Overtemp Values
 
3.1.4.1.3  Processing
The THEMAS system shall compare the reported temperature value to the temperature setting and detect when the temperature value exceeds the specified limits.                                                  To clarify these conditions, the following definitions will be used:
 
LO : Lower Overtemperature Value = TSET - OD UO : Upper Overtemperature Value = TSET + OD
 
If T < LO or UO < T then the THEMAS system shall recognize this condition as the temperature limit has been exceeded.                                                       In this case this process shall output the condition of the temperature limit having been exceeded.
 
If LO < = T < = UO, then this process shall output the temperature status.

3.1.5.1.1  Introduction
The THEMAS system shall control each of the heating and cooling units that are defined for the system.                                                   The THEMAS system shall limit the number of heating or cooling units t hat may be running simultaneously.
 
3.1.5.1.2  Inputs Operational Parameters H/C Request
 
3.1.5.1.3  Processing
The THEMAS system shall maintain the ON/OFF status of each heating and cooling unit.                                      When a request to turn on or off a heating or cooling unit, the following processing will occur.
 
When a request to turn on a heating or cooling unit is received, the system shall determine if the request can be honored.                                    If the maximum number of heating or cooling units is already running, the request will be add ed to a LIFO queue.                                                                              If the maximum number of heating or cooling units is not running, this process will generate a request to turn on the requested unit.
 
When a request to turn off a heating or cooling unit is received, this process shall check the queue of waiting heating and cooling requests.                          If the queue is not empty, this process shall remove one request from the LIFO queue and check the current state of the thermostat for which the queued request was made.                                                                                                   If that thermostat still needs a heating o r cooling unit turned on, this process shall submit a request to turn that unit on.

3.1.5.2  Generate Unit Unavailable Event (SRS -012)
 
3.1.5.2.1  Introduction
When a request for a heating unit or cooling to be turned is denied, an event shall be generated and the THEMAS system shall record that event.  The information in these events will be used for creating statistical reports.
 
3.1.5.2.2  Inputs Unit Unavailable
 
3.1.5.2.3  Processing
This procedure shall realize the thermostat and heating or cooling information and use this information to generate a specific system event.                                                            This system event shall consist of a description of the event type (a request denied event), a designation of the thermostat that made the request, and a designation of the heating or cooling unit that was not turned on.
 
3.1.5.2.4  Outputs System Event Data

3.1.5.3.2  Inputs H/C ON/OFF Request
 
3.1.5.3.3  Processing
When a request to turn on or off a heating or cooling unit is made, this process shall generate the appropriate request to carry out that request.              This request shall include the designation of the heating or cooling unit and a flag to indicate whether that unit is to be turned on or off.
 
3.1.5.3.4  Outputs Approved H/C Request
 
3.1.6  Generate H/C Signal (SRS -014)
3.1.6.1  Introduction
Once a request to turn on or off a heating or cooling unit, the THEMAS system shall provide the necessary control signal for the unit.  This control signal shall also provide an indication of the unit’s status at the requesting thermostat.


 
 
3.1.6.2  Inputs Approved H/C Request
 
3.1.6.3  Processing
This process shall recognize the values for the requested heating or cooling unit and the ON or OFF status that is being requested. The necessary signal to the heating or cooling unit will be generated. Since the interface to control the units has not been defined, the part of this process that will issue the signal is designated as TBD(to be determined).
 
In order to provide an indication of the status of the heating or cooling unit back to the requesting thermostat, this procedure shall output the status information of the heating or cooling unit.
 
In order to provide an operational history and statistical reports, this process shall generate an event each time a change is made to the status of a heating or cooling unit.                                                                                                      This ev ent shall contain the identification of the heating or cooling unit whose status is being changed.

System Events
 
3.1.7.1  Introduction
There are two events that shall result in an alarm condition: 1) an invalid temperature value is reported from a thermostat, or 2) the reported temperature has exceeded the defined limits.                                                                                                                              This process shall determine which alarm event is to be generated.
 
3.1.7.2  Inputs Invalid Temperature
Temperature Limit Exceeded
3.1.7.3  Processing
When the THEMAS system detects a request for an alarm, this process shall detect which of the two alarms are being requested.
 
If the system detects an invalid temperature, this process shall output a continuous series of alternating 500 Hz and 700 Hz beeps on the supervisor’s computer.                                               Each beep shall have a three - quarter second duration.                                    This series of beeps shall continue until the supervisor manually resets the alarm through the supervisor’s interface window.


 
 
If the system detects a temperature limit has been exceeded, this process shall output a continuous series of alternating 1000 Hz and 1500 Hz beeps on the supervisor’s computer.                                            Each beep shall have a one-half second duration.                                                      This series of beeps shall continue until the supervisor manually resets the alarm through the supervisor’s interface window.
 
Each time an alarm is requested, an alarm event shall be recorded.   This event shall be used to provide operational and statistical reports about the system.
 
3.1.7.4  Outputs Alarm Data Alarm Events
 
3.1.8.1  Introduction
For each event that is generated, the THEMAS system shall identify each event and generate the appropriate event data.
 
3.1.8.2  Inputs Alarm Events System Events Denied H/C Request
 
3.1.8.3  Processing
When an event occurs, the THEMAS system shall identify the event type and format an appropriate event message.                                               The THEMAS system shall record each event by a description and the current system time for that event.                               This information shall be recorded in a Microsoft Access database that shall reside on the supervisor’s computer.
 
3.1.8.4  Outputs Event Data
 
 
3.1.9.1  Introduction
The THEMAS system shall provide the supervisor a mechanism to change the temperature setting of any of the thermostats in the system.
 
3.1.9.2  Inputs Operational Parameters
 
3.1.9.4  Processing
The supervisor’s interface shall display the available thermostats and the ir individual current temperature settings.


 
The supervisor shall be able to select one of the thermostats and select a value for the current temperature from a list of valid temperatures.
 
3.1.9.5  Outputs Temperature Data
 
3.1.10  Generate Reports (SRS -018)
3.1.10.1  Introduction
The THEMAS shall provide the ability for the supervisor to select between two different types of reports: 1) the operational history of the THEMAS system for the past twelve months and 2) a statistical summary for any selected mont h.
 
3.1.10.2  Inputs Event Data
 
3.1.10.3  Processing
The supervisor’s interface to the THEMAS system shall provide a mechanism to select between an operational history report or a statistical summary report.                                           Either report shall consist of an ASCII file whose location and name shall be selectable by the operator.
 
If the operational history report is selected, the THEMAS system shall select all the events from the event database, sort the events by date and time, and create the ASCII report file.
 
If the statistical report is selected, the THEMAS system shall present the operator with a list of available months from which to make a selection.                                                       After selecting one of the months, the system shall generate the ASCII report file.                                                  The statistical reports shall consist of the following statistics:
 
1.        The percentage of time each heating and cooling unit was on for each day of that month.
 
2.        For each thermometer, the ratio of the number of requests for a heating and cooling unit that was granted to the number of requests for a heating or cooling unit that was denied.
 






1. Environmental Mode: This is the real-time operations that must react to varying degrees of readiness to full scale wartime operations such as crisis planning with the use of heterogeneous data types and sources, transfer capabilities, data management services.
2. COE Compliance. XML Services shall be segmented. COE sponsors shall adhere to compliance level requirements described in the I&RTS.
3. In the fixed (static) mode of operation (base or data processing megacenter), the data management services shall have the capability of being tuned by on-site personnel to adjust for varying workloads and sizes of associated databases. These workloads and databases are expected to change more frequently and to a greater extent than for processing associated with deployed units
4. In a changing (dynamic) environment, such as with deployed units, the workload and database sizes may be more predetermined (given a more precise mission) and require access to fewer data management administrative capabilities than needed in a fixed environment. The XS shall have the ability to redefine or reset names of connect descriptors to database server instances. Connect descriptors are fully qualified object names and include address (protocol/host/port) and instance name.
5. In a degraded communications environment, there is a need, for example, to be able to reset session time-out values if the data management services are being accessed by users affected by the communications degradation. At a minimum, the session time-out values shall be user definable and be able to be reset prior to initialization of a user session. The goal is to provide the option of dynamically changing session time values based on current communications performance identified by capabilities of the network management or DBMS.
6.  End User Mode: Portion of XS services shall be used by various classes of users: data consumers, data and database managers, network information infrastructure resource managers. Some of these uses of the data management services will entail unique requirements that shall be fulfilled within the capability of XS services.
7.  Maintenance Mode: This mode includes modification and/or addition of application data segments, user permission, privileges, and restructuring storage and memory areas. In addition, maintenance also shall pertain to shutdown, open not-mounted and online/off-line implementations, modifications, upgrade, or other related actions. The data management services shall support managing various types of data, database architectures and platforms that includes hardware and software at the specified sites.
8. Training Mode. In support of training activities, the data management services shall provide for the same processing as would be encountered in a production environment. However, access to the database may be via a training application access to the DBMS rather than from the production mission application.
9. QUALIFICATION PROVISIONS
10. COE Software will be qualified through formal validation tests of the SRS level requirements. The Qualification Methods applied to the software shall include test, demonstration, analysis, and inspection (T, D, A, I).

   1. TEST
   2. A qualification method that is carried out by operation of the item/component/I/F (or some part of the computer S/W configuration item, etc.) and that relies on the collection and subsequent examination of data.
DEMONSTRATION
   3. A qualification method that is carried out by operation of the item/component/I/F (or some part of the computer S/W configuration item, etc.), and that relies on observable functional operation not requiring the use of elaborate instrumentation or special test equipment.
ANALYSIS
   4. A qualification method that is carried out by the processing of accumulated data. An example of accumulated data is the compilation of data obtained from other qualification methods. Examples of the processing of accumulated data are interpretations or extrapolations made from the data.
INSPECTION
A qualification method that is carried out by visual examination, physical manipulation, or measurement to verify that the requirements have been satisfied.
Automatically: Indicates processing initiated during execution of other processes, but dependent on information and/or parameters to be generated or supplied to these other processes. The information / parameters may be data dependent, or application dependent, or dependent on a manual process/human intervention. It will include controls qualifying the processing involved.
Business Rule: A narrative description of policies, procedures, or principles within an organization. Business rules can be divided in to four categories: definitions, facts, constraints, and derivations.
Definitions are business rules that define entities and attributes.
Facts are either links (relationships) between entities or associations
between an entity and attributes
Constraints are conditions about the data that must always be true. They are the integrity rules that protect the data in the eventual database.
Derivations are business rules that materialize a new piece of information (often attribute values) from other pieces of information. For example, a mathematical derivation might specify that you can obtain a person's age by subtracting his or her birth date from the current date.
Commit/Rollback: An individual transaction is processed (commit) or discarded (rollback) by the proponent maintainer of the data items involved.
Discretionary Access Controls (DAC): A means of restricting access to objects based on the identity of subjects or groups to which they belong. The controls are discretionary in the sense that a subject with a certain access permission is capable of passing that permission on to any other subject.
Dynamically Generated Processing: Indicates processing initiated during execution of other processes, but dependent upon information and/or parameters to be generated or supplied to these other processes. The information/parameters may be data dependent, or application dependent, or dependent on a manual process/human intervention. It will include controls qualifying the processing involved.
Location Transparency: occurs when the physical location of data is transparent to the applications and users of the database system. For example, a view that joins table data from several databases provides location transparency because the user of the view does not need to know where the data originates from.

Mandatory Access Control (MAC): mediates access to an object based on the clearance level of the subject (user) and the sensitivity label of the object. (These controls are always enforced above any discretionary control implemented by users).
Mirrored Databases: Replication and maintenance of a database on a transaction basis for the purpose of rapid error or failure recovery as supported by the resident COTS RDBMS own system utilities and operating system.
Object: A passive entity that contains or receives information. Access to an object potentially implies access to the information it contains. Examples of objects are records, blocks, pages, segments, files, directories, directory trees, and programs, as well as bits, bytes, words, fields, processors, video displays, keyboards, clocks, printers, and network nodes.
Proponent Scheme: Describes the sites at which databases are replicated and also who owns and has update authority with respect to the data at each site. It refers to proponency at the source and record level.
Redundant Array of Inexpensive Disks (RAID): A RAID system appears as one very large, reliable disk to the CPU. The main reason for using RAID storage is its reliability. RAID has the same advantages as shadowing and striping at a lower cost. There are several types/levels of RAID implementations, including: RAID 0 (known as disk striping), RAID 1 (known as disk shadowing), RAID 3 (in which data is distributed in small increments across all data disks and adds a parity value to a separate disk for recovery if any disk fails, RAID 4 (in which data is distributed in large chunks across all data disks and also has a single parity disk. RAID 4 intended to overcome performance penalties of RAID 3 for small transfers. RAID 5 (in which parity over RAID 3 or RAID 4 implementations), and RAID 6 ( in which two parity disks in addition to data disks are used in an attempt to further improve performance). In a RAID 5 implementation, the data is stored as are check sums and other information about the contents of each disk in the array. If one disk is lost, the others can use the check sums and other stored information to recreate the lost data. Storage system vendors may provide additional enhancements to RAID level implementations to improve performance and reliability.
Remote Data Access (RDA): is an ISO (9579) application layer interoperability standard (protocol and formats) to support access by an application to a (remote) DBMSs over an OSI network. The goal of RDA is to allow interoperability between applications (clients) and databases (servers) of different manufacturers so that an application is able to read and update data in remote databases via well defined standards. RDA defines a set of client and server standards and a mapping of SQL commands to these services. RDA also defines an interface to ISO (transaction processing) two phase commit TP services in the case where updates to multiple remote databases need to be coordinated. RDA does not yet define interoperability between server databases (i.e. it is not yet a standard for distributed database management).

Replication Scheme: Information that precisely identifies DBs, or partitions of DBs, to be copied and/or distributed, replication schedules, and master/remote sites that are to receive the copies.
Spatial DBMS: Geographic information system that organizes and maintains spatial data (i.e. data with graphical attributes) in terms of type, scale, location(s), extent, topology and geometry. Supports queries of spatial data where the selection criteria are defined by spatial attributes.
SRI: A Standing Request For Information (SRI) is a capability in which CASS monitors for the occurrence of conditions established by an application program, and notifies the calling or establishing application program when the conditions are satisfied. An SRI may be one of three types: timer-based, data-based, or message-based.
Subject: An active entity, generally in the form of a person, process, or device that causes information to flow among objects or changes the system state. Technically, a process/domain pair.
Transaction Journalling: Individual messages or database transactions are stored in a journal file, which may be a linear log file or a circular file.

 Introduction
This document formally states the requirements for the MultiMahjong product.
These requirements have been prioritised into three levels:
      1. Essential
The minimum set of requirements for the product to be accepted (see Section 8).
      2. Highly Desirable
Requirements that are considered to be likely inclusions to the product, time permitting.
      3. Desirable
Requirements that are not likely to be added in this version, but should be considered for future modifications.
MultiMahjong is a product consisting of two programs - a MultiMahjongServer and a MultiMahjongClient. This Server/Client architecture will allow up to 4 players to play Mahjong against each other over a TCP/IP network. The MultiMahjongClient program will also allow 1 player to play in a stand-alone mode.
As any game of Mahjong requires 4 players to play, and there may not be 4 people available for a network game, the game will allow users to choose enough computer opponents to make up the required 4 players. In a single player game, the user will play against 3 computer opponents.
To play the game, users will use the MultiMahjongClient. The MultiMahjongServer is to reside on a TCP/IP server and will communicate with MultiMahjongClients.
The client requires the product for commercial purposes. The MultiMahjongClient program is to be sold to potential users and the MultiMahjongServer is to initially reside on a server owned or operated by the client.
The client has no existing system for MultiMahjong.
 
This section states the requirements that relate to the functionality of the MultiMahjong system. Each requirement has been prioritised according to the levels set out in the Introduction . 
Note that for single player games, the MultiMahjongServer will not be required and the player need not be connected to a TCP/IP network. Although many requirements mention that the MultiMahjongClient will send certain information to the MultiMahjongServer, in the single player game, this is not the case. In a single player game, the MultiMahjongClient will intercept this information and process it internally. The reference to the MultiMahjongServer is made to reduce duplicate requirements.
         * Level 1 Requirements:
4.1.1 
	The MultiMahjongServer will be designed to reside on a central computer (server) that is connected to a TCP/IP network and has a unique IP address.
	4.1.2 
	The MultiMahjongServer will allow connections from MultiMahjongClients and communicate with them using IP.
	4.1.3
	The MultiMahjongServer will serve as a node for MultiMahjongClients. That is, it will be able to relay data received from one MultiMahjongClient to other MultiMahjongClients that request it.
	         * 
Level 2 Requirements:
4.1.4 
	The MultiMahjongServer will automate the game initialisation functions (as opposed to the MultiMahjongClient doing them), such as: randomising tile order, randomising seating position and storing the "Game Info" database (see Figure 3.1.2).
	4.1.5 
	The MultiMahjongServer will contain a High Scores list with the names and scores of the top MultiMahjong players.
	            * 
Level 3 Requirements:
4.1.6 
	The MultiMahjongServer will allow players on MultiMahjongClient programs to chat with each other in real time.
	4.1.7 
	The MultiMahjongServer will allow players on MultiMahjongClient programs to modify their own names and icons during gameplay (as opposed to only at the beginning).
	4.1.8 
	The MultiMahjongServer will support an architecture whereby all Computer Opponents (CO) required will reside on it instead of on the MultiMahjongClient programs.
	4.1.9 
	The MultiMahjongServer will have a graphical user interface with which the administrator of the server can get log information and change game settings.
	4.1.10 
	The MultiMahjongServer will be able to save preferences to a file and read from that file at start-up.
	               * 
Note that all requirements hereafter are concerned with the MultiMahjongClient program.
4.2 Beginning the Game
                  * Level 1 Requirements:
4.2.1 
	When the user begins the MultiMahjongClient program, they will be able to choose to create a new multi player game, to create a new single player game, to join an existing multi player game, or to quit the program. These options will be available at any stage while the program is running as long as there is no game currently being played by the user (see Section 4.4 for more details about quitting).
	4.2.2
	When a user creates a new multi player game, they must:
4.2.2.1
	Enter their name.
	4.2.2.2
	Choose an icon from a predetermined list.
	4.2.2.3 
	Decide the number of human and computer opponents they want. As any game of Mahjong requires 4 players, the MultiMahjongClient will limit the user to choosing 4 players in total.
	4.2.2.4
	Set the score limit for winning a hand of Mahjong.
	4.2.2.5
	When all the necessary human players have joined the game, the user may choose to begin the game.
	

	4.2.3 
	The MultiMahjongClient must send this game initialisation information to the MultiMahjongServer so that the MultiMahjongServer can create a new game.
	4.2.4 
	The processing for any Computer Opponents (CO) (see Section 4.5 for more detail) will be done by the MultiMahjongClient program. In a single player game, the MultiMahjongClient will need to process for 3 COs. In a multi player game with 2 human players, each MultiMahjongClient will support 1 CO. In a multi player game with 3 human players, only 1 of the 3 MultiMahjongClients will support a CO. Obviously, in a multi player game with 4 human players, no CO is required.
	4.2.5 
	When a user creates a new single player game, they must:
4.2.5.1
	Enter their name.
	4.2.5.2 
	Choose an icon from a predetermined list.
	4.2.5.3 
	Set the score limit for winning a hand of Mahjong.
	

	4.2.6 
	When a user selects the option to join an existing game, the MultiMahjongClient will retrieve a list of any games that still require players from the MultiMahjongServer.
	4.2.7 
	When a user wishes to join a multi player game, they must:
4.2.7.1 
	Enter their name.
	4.2.7.2 
	Choose an icon from a predetermined list.
	4.2.7.3 
	Choose which of the available games they wish to join.
	

	4.2.8 
	The MultiMahjongClient must send this join information to the MultiMahjongServer.
	4.2.9 
	In a multi player game, each MultiMahjongClient must retrieve the following data from the MultiMahjongServer:
4.2.9.1 
	Whether it must support a CO.
	4.2.9.2 
	The score limit for a hand.
	4.2.9.3
	All players' names, icons and seating positions.
	4.2.9.4
	The tiles of the human and CO (optional) player supported on the MultiMahjongClient.
	

	                  * Level 2 Requirements:
4.2.10 
	The list of un-started games that the MultiMahjongClient fetches from the MultiMahjongServer will be displayed in such a way that users can see the following information about each game:
4.2.10.1 
	The name and icon of the player who created the game.
	4.2.10.2 
	The score limit for winning a hand.
	4.2.10.3
	The number of places that still need to be filled before the game can commence.
	

	4.2.11 
	The MultiMahjongClient will save the user preferences in a file and read them in when the program begins.
	                  * Level 3 Requirements:
4.2.12
	Users who create a new game will be able to change the ability level of any CO involved in the game. There will be 3 levels available: Beginner, Intermediate and Advanced.
	4.2.13 
	Users who create a new game will be able to choose to play different variations of Mahjong rules other than those described in Section 4.3.1. The variations will include the Cleared Hand variation and the Japanese variation (see the rulebook for more detail).
	4.2.14
	Any user who creates or joins a game will be able to upload their own JPEG or GIF image that they wish to have displayed above their name, if they do not wish to use a preset icon.
	                  * 4.3 Playing the Game
                  * Level 1 Requirements:

	4.4.3
	The MultiMahjongServer will inform all MultiMahjongClients connected to the game that the game has ended. Users of any MultiMahjongClient previously connected to the game will have the choice to quit the program or to begin/join a new game.
	                  * 
Level 2 Requirements:
4.4.4 
	If a user leaves the game prematurely, a new CO is created on another user's machine to fill their place. This CO will take over the user's current position and circumstance within the game. This CO will play at an ability level as defined in the Level 2 Requirements for the CO (see Section 4.5.6).
	                     * 
Level 3 Requirements:

                                                                                       * This section describes a possible scenario that incorporates some of the requirements mentioned in this document. As some of the requirements used are Level 2 and Level 3 requirements, the actual implementation of the product may not reflect this scenario exactly.
9.1 Beginning the Game
                                                                                       * The administrator runs the MultiMahjongServer program on a server . This program begins running and waits for MultiMahjongClients to connect.
A user, Bob, runs the MultiMahjongClient program on another computer. A dialogue box appears on the Bob's computer displaying the options to begin the game. Bob enters his name, chooses an icon, sets the score limit and decides to select one human opponent and two CO opponents . Bob then waits for a human opponent to join.
Another user, Sally, also runs the MultiMahjongClient program, enters her details and selects to join an existing game from the dialogue box. The MultiMahjongClient retrieves a list of the available games (including Bob's) from the MultiMahjongServer . The MultiMahjongClient displays this list on the screen. Sally selects Bob's game and joins the game.
Bob sees that Sally has joined and selects to begin the game. The MultiMahjongServer receives the begin game command from Bob's MultiMahjongClient and it initialises all information necessary to begin the game and sends it to both Sally's and Bob's MultiMahjongClients. The processing for one CO player will be done by the MultiMahjongClient running on Bob's machine, the other by the MultiMahjongClient running on Sally's machine.
9.2 Playing the Game
                                                                                       * A main window containing all the game information is displayed on both Sally's and Bob's screens.
Bob, Sally and the CO's take turns in picking up and discarding tiles . After Sally discards a certain tile, Bob can Chow, and a button named 'Chow' in his main window becomes active . Bob chooses to Chow by clicking on this button. Bob's MultiMahjongClient sends this move to the MultiMahjongServer, which subsequently sends this move to the other MultiMahjongClient . The tiles in both Bob's and Sally's main window are updated to show that Bob has Chow'ed.
The hand continues in this fashion, with all players making moves within the Chinese rules of Mahjong . After a few moves, the combination of tiles in Sally's hand allows her to Mahjong and a button named 'Mahjong' becomes active in her main window. Sally clicks this button and a new hand begins. When all hands have been played, the Wind of the Round indicator is updated and a new round begins. The game continues in this fashion
9.3 Ending the Game
At the end of the 4th round, Bob goes Mahjong. Bob's MultiMahjongClient sends this information to the MultiMahjongServer (4.3.8) which sends it to the other MultiMahjongClient (4.3.1). The main window on both MultiMahjongClients is closed and the original dialogue box (6.3.6) is displayed (4.4.3).
Both Bob and Sally choose to quit the program and the MultiMahjongClients on both machines exit (4.4.1).

SENDER Communication channel 5.System Design Specification: 5.1 Architecture Design: 5.1.1 Data Flow Diagram(DFD): It is a way of representing system requirements in graphical form;this led to modular design.A DFD describes a data flow(logical) rather than how they are processed.So they do not depend upon software,hardware,data structure or file organization.It is also known as ‘bubble sort’. A DFD is a structured analysis and a design tool that can be used for flowcharting in place of ,or in association with ,information-oriented and process oriented system flowcharts. A DFD is considered as an abstract of the logic of information-oriented or process-oriented system flowchart.The four basic symbols used to construct data flow diagrams are- A rectangle represents a data source or destination. SENDER RECEIVER A directed line represents flow of data. An Oval represents a process that transforms into streams. An Open ended rectangle represents storage. The points at which data is transformed are called as nodes.The principle processes that take place at nodes are: 1.Combining data streams 2.Splitting data streams 3.Modifying data streams 










1    B2B eCommerce Requirements    Manufacturing, Distribution & Wholesale    2 Table of Contents 001 Key B2B Concepts 002 Online Store Front-End Requirements 003 Communication / Email Requirements 004 Backend / Platform Requirements 005 Integration Requirements 006 Hosting, Security & Support 04 06 10 11 14 16 3    This document outlines the necessary eCommerce software requirements for a typical B2B company. We use the term B2B to refer to any company selling directly to other businesses, government entities or nonprofits. These requirements are intended to be a starting point for your team, and can be used to help you customize a requirements document that’s based on your specific business use case. When looking to source an eCommerce platform, you’ll find that the vast majority of existing solutions have significant technological and functionality gaps. These platforms typically fall into one of two camps:   Retail software with great merchandising/marketing capabilities, but limited B2B functionality.   B2B software with exceptional back-office, but limited merchandising/ marketing capabilities. Understanding this landscape enables your team to select the best solution, with the right balance of back-office functionality and merchandising/marketing capabilities. Overview & Purpose of Document 4    Account Management 001 Key B2B Concepts When selling to organizations, there’s often a need to have multiple layers of accounts. There will typically be a “Parent” account for the organization and various levels of “Sub-Accounts” in which company employees can make purchases on behalf of the larger organization. Often a buyer’s decision to order from company A vs. company B comes down to who has the inventory and when it can be delivered. The ability to give up-to-date and accurate availability information becomes instrumental in gaining and retaining customers, while minimizing the workload of providing manual estimates over the phone. The other key metric buyers use in their purchasing decision is price. It’s essential to provide competitive pricing and to have the ability to showcase various price points based on economies of scale. Typically, this is highlighted in quantity-based pricing and various price tiers, based on the volume of product that a customer orders. These can also be pre-established price rates that a sales rep has negotiated with the customer. Whatever the methodology, it’s critical to provide accurate pricing based on the account that is logged in, and also display potentially better price points to encourage increased ordering. Sale orders in B2B eCommerce often have large quantities: tens, hundreds or even thousands of items on a single order. Retail eCommerce platforms struggle with the usability of the data at this There are a number of key concepts that are unique to B2B eCommerce and are important to understand before starting implementation: Inventory Availability Information Pricing Bulk Order & Re-Ordering 5    001 Key B2B Concepts scale. Bulk order entry requires a different user interface to allow key features, such as the ability to duplicate a previous order and use it as a starting point for new orders, which make the system useable. In B2B eCommerce, it’s not uncommon for transaction totals to reach thousands or even hundreds of thousands of dollars. Using credit cards for transactions of that size simply isn’t logical for many companies, so it’s critical to allow the submission of Purchase Orders, with terms. However, offering this service requires work on a number of additional functional requirements such as establishing credit limits, entering PO numbers, generating invoices and tracking invoice payments. In addition, the system should provide a process for an employee to initiate a transaction and then have it approved by someone in procurement or finance. When placing large orders, a customer may need to have items shipped to multiple locations. There are many features, outlined below, that can assist in this process. Additionally, it’s essential for the eCommerce application to determine the best location to send goods from when providing shipping rate quotes. Providing real time, accurate, and competitive shipping rates is extremely important to gain new customers, satisfy existing customers and optimize shipping costs and timing. Lastly, it’s important to note that product catalog, inventory levels, account information, and order/fulfillment details may need to be pushed and pulled from third party systems such as ERP, CRM, Account, Warehouse Management or other software applications. In fact, both vendor systems and customer systems often need to be integrated. It’s critical that the eCommerce system be able to easily integrate with these types of platforms and do real-time data handoffs when appropriate. Payment Methods & Approval Cahins Multiple Fullfillments & Shipping Addresses System Integrations 6      Mobile-friendly design (responsive design)   Speed of website (critical to conversion rates as

UNIT :II Hardware and Software Requirements for E-Commerce Web Server Meaning • It refers to a common computer, which provides information to other computers on the internet. • It is either the hardware (the computer) or the software (the computer programs) that stores the digital information (web content) and delivers it through Internet whenever required. The three components to a web server • The Hardware • Operating system software • web server software Website & Internet Utility Programs Meaning of Website • A Website is a collection of related web pages on a web server maintained by any individual or organization. • A website is hosted on web server, accessible via internet or private LAN through an internet address called URL (Uniform Resource Locator). All publicly accessible websites collectively constitute the WWW (world wide web) Meaning of Utility Programs These are software tools to help users in developing, writing and documenting programs (a sequence of instructions to a computer) There are 2 types of utility programs 1) File Management Utilities – it helps in creating, copying, printing, erasing and renaming the files. 2) Program Development Utilities – it is useful in assembler, compiler, linker, locator etc, Website & utility programs include: Electronic Mail – sending & receiving messages globally via internet. Use Net News – it’s a software that enables a group of internet users to exchange their view, ideas, information on some common topic of interest with all members belonging to the group. Ex:-politics, social issues, sports etc. Real Time Chatting – It is an internet program available to users across the net to talk to each other, text messages, video chat and video conference via internet. Finger and Ping Finger – it is the utility program used to find some information about the users that are on the network. Ex: - last time a user logged on to the network Ping (Packet Internet Groper) – it is a program used to test the connectivity between two computers connected to the internet. Connection with the internet to ensure proper network Tracer (Route Tracing Program) – it is a program that sends data packets to every computer on the path between one computer to another computer in the network and records the time it takes to reach the destination computer from the originating computer. Telnet and FTP Telnet – it is a software that allows one computer user to access files and run programs on another computer that is connected to the internet. FTP - (FILE TRANSFER PROTOCOL) it is a service used on internet to exchange files between computer. Indexing & Searching Utility programs it helps the search engine to search the specific website (Search for Information) Data Analysis Program – it is software used to obtain the visitor information. i.e., website visitor is accessing, time lag the website viewed, the date and time of each visit, pages viewed etc., Line checking utility program – it examines each page on the website and reports any URLs broken or someway incorrect. Besides checking links, link checker programs sometimes check spelling and other structural components of web pages. Remote Server Administration Program – this software allows the web administrator to manage and monitor a website from any Internet connected computer. Web Hosting It means to store website contents on a web server. It is a type of service, provided by Internet. Service Providers that allow individuals and organizations to make their website accessible when people browse via the www. Thus, web hosts are companies that provide space on a server owned or leased for use by clients. There are two choices to host the website: - i) On own web server platform (in house) ii) On the platform of someone else (i.e., ISP's) TYPES OF WEB HOSTING - Choice of web hosting • Home Server – it is a single machine placed in a private residence used to host one or few websites from a broadband connection. • Free Web Hosting service – it is the type of service provided by web hosting companies free of cost with limited services. The hosting companies offer free space on their web server with a condition that some advertisements are allowed on the web pages. Later the business can change the package by paying. • Shared Website Hosting - it refers to hosting of multiple websites simultaneously on the same web server. The web host also maintains the server and provides technical support on it. • Virtual Dedicated Hosting – In this type the client or user will have a dedicated web server with separate bandwidth and RAM. The user will be given ID and password to maintain the web server – the user can install or remove any software. • Dedicated Hosting – the service provider makes a web server available to the client and has control over it. The service provider owns server hardware and software but leases it to the client. • Managed Hosting – in this type ,the client user gets his own web server but is not allowed full control on it.(no install or remove software) • Colocation Hosting – in this type the service provider rents a physical space to the client to install his/her server hardware. In other words, co-location allows a client to put his machine in a service provider's premises to avail all the available facilities. The client installs his own software and maintains the server. The service provider is responsible only for providing a reliable power supply, internet connection and other networking hardware. • Cloud hosting – it is a new type of hosting platform that allows clients a decentralized, powerful, scalable (i.e., can be upgraded or a new server added as necessary) and reliable hosting, based on clustered load-balanced servers and utility billing. A cloud hosted website may be more reliable than other choices since other computers in the cloud can compensate when a single piece of hardware goes down. • Clustered Hosting -Multiple servers hosting the same content for better resources is called Clustered Hosting. ,, • Grid Hosting – it is a form of distributed hosting where a server clusters acts like a grid and is composed of multiple clients. E-commerce Requirement Telecommunication Infrastructure Requirements – it is entailed with bandwidth and security. Bandwidth varies from one e-commerce to another. Two main components of security requirements for e-commerce are type of firewall and encryption/algorithm mechanism. Security requirements area crucial part of e-commerce. Hardware Requirement for E-commerce - Pentium II/III based Intel server running Linux can serve hundreds of unique customers each day. Low traffic sites can be easily served from a single machine depending on the needs of the business. High traffic sites require a backup of servers which automatically takes over operations in case of failure of primary ones. Software Requirements for E-commerce – Several software are available free on the internet that can be used to build e-commerce exchanges. Ex:- Linux OS, mySQL database ,Apache web server etc., Technical Skill -A systems administrator must have a good knowledge of computer hardware, must be able to maintain and upgrade hardware including hard drive, processor and motherboard. He/she must also have the skill to install and compile Apache, MySQL and Java servlet engine. Financial Infrastructure - i) Dependable telecommunication network ii) Use of integrated banking software for ack office and front office data processing iii) Use of WAN and internet for banking operations iv) Availability of legal infrastructure supporting online payment mechanism. V) Availability of EFT Legal and Policy framework – policies that ensure legal certainty, security and consumer protection for online transactions and interactions should be enacted. These include the resolution of issues such as transactional security, electronic contract enforceability and authentication of individuals and documentation. E-commerce software Catalogue display A catalogue is an organized list of goods & services being sold. An e-catalogue is a simple list of goods and services in HTML form that appears on a webpage on the website of an ecommerce company. Two types (i)static catalogue -providing simple list of goods and services on offer. (ii) dynamic catalogue -providing a detailed feature about items on sale in a database, detailed descriptions, shipment time etc., Shopping Cart It is an electronic basket provided by E-commerce service providers to be used by net users to keep track of the products selected in the basket, compare and review them, modify it by adding new ones or removing unwanted goods before finally deciding to purchase. After the shopping is completed the customer will make the payment through online. Features or Procedures for Shopping cart • Compare and select the goods before purchasing. • Select the goods easily -by clicking. • Customize the product based on the size, quantity, colour etc., before proceeding to order. • Getting information about the offers, discounts & price. • Specify the payment mode like credit card, debit card, cheque, online payment, payment at the time of delivery etc., • Mention the venue for delivery of selected goods. • Compute shipping charges and obtain information about taxes to incur. • Get information about delivery time. • Have transaction confirmation message and transaction report through an email or SMS. • Transact securely with the web seller. • Transaction Processing It is the software that prompts processing the transaction when an online customer orders for a purchase.

CHAPTER 1. INTRODUCTION
 
It is known globally that, in today’s market, it is extremely difficult to start a new small- scale business and its sustenance with competition from the well-established and settled/brand owners. Most often, even if the quality of the product is really good, due to a lack of advertisement or business at the small scale, it just becomes another face in the sea, and the product does not reach a larger group of customers. In fast paced life of today when everyone is squeezed for time, the majority of people are finicky when it comes to doing physical shopping. Logistically, a consumer finds a product more interesting and attractive when they find it on the website of a retailer directly and are able to see item’s details online.[4][5] The customers of today are not only attracted because online shopping is very convenient, but also because they have broader selections, highly competitive prices, better information about the product (including people’s reviews) and extremely simplified navigation for searching regarding the product.
Moreover, business owners often offer online shopping options at low rates because the overhead expenses in opening and running a physical store are higher. Further, with online shopping, their products have access to a worldwide market, which increases the number of customers from different ethnic groups, adds customer value, and overall sustainable in the marketing.[8]
Online web stores, such as Amazon and eBay, have gained huge popularity over the years because one can buy almost everything at these stores. These web stores also give an opportunity to a lot of small-scale companies and manufactures to reach the global market and to directly sell their products to people without involving different other companies or middlemen before their product can reach the shelves of a physical store. Further, instead of using the available platforms, manufacturers can bring a concept of designing their own web store to sell their products directly to the masses.


1.1.  Motivation
 
The motivation for designing this shopping-cart application came because I love online shopping rather than spending lot of time at physical markets. Further, using the available stores to sell the products, there is also the possibility of designing one’s own customized shopping-cart application from scratch because custom-designed platforms are expensive. Moreover, I value recent learning about the Java and JavaScript programming languages as well as seeing how powerful and dynamic they are when it comes to web designing and applications. Apart from helping computer science students understand the concepts of web-application designing, it would be very easy to incorporate the idea of using programming techniques from the available visuals to understand how a piece of code appears on a user interface. The languages used to build this application are JavaScript, HTML, and Java because I found them to be extremely useful while working on the technologies at my workplace, Thomson Reuters.
1.2.  Aim of the Software
 
This software is developed to help computer science students learn about application designing using JavaScript and HTML from their basic capabilities. This application allows the student to understand the basics about the appearance of a first web page and how a complete working application can be built from scratch. It allows students to understand the concept of user-integrated graphics and how JavaScript can be embedded into HTML. Further, it gives insight about how the client-side language interacts with the server-side language, Java, and finally with the database. This shopping-cart application is designed, primarily, for computer science students to learn and understand the concept of application development, and can also be used to teach ecommerce and web-application topics. The application can be downloaded and


installed on different machines, and students can view the source code for all the different parts shown on the UI to visually understand how a particular piece of code works. This shopping-cart application is very versatile and can be enhanced by adding more functions and modified graphics for use with commercial purposes.
1.3.  Literature Review
 
The history of ecommerce shopping carts began immediately after the World Wide Web, or WWW, became a major medium to communicate information around the world. Ecommerce shopping-cart applications allow consumers to buy goods or services directly over the internet using a web browser. This online shopping evokes the business-to-consumer (B2C) process where a consumer buys directly from the business. The process where a business buys from another business is called a business-to-business (B2B) process. The best examples of shopping- cart applications using B2B process are eBay and Amazon, both of which were launched in 1995. At present, most users of these online shopping-cart applications are people who have higher levels of education, have exposure to technological advancements, and are in a better income group. Such users develop a positive attitude towards these convenient shopping techniques.[7] According to a study in December 2011, Equation Research surveyed 1,500 online shoppers and found that 87% of tablet owners made online transactions during the early Christmas shopping season. [6]
Building a new successful shopping cart is simple because of high competition in the market, and the designer of a shopping-cart application must consider the information load, complexity, and novelty.[9] Complexity refers to the number of features available on the shopping cart and the levels of marketing, whereas novelty involves the unexpected or unfamiliar aspects of the site. A designer must also consider the consumers’ needs and expectations. A user-


friendly design is very critical to the success of any shopping-cart application because, unlike physical stores, consumers at online stores come from all ages, genders, and cultures.[10] Logistics clearly says that, to have a successful and profitable online shopping application, businesses have to spend a significant amount of time and money for designing, developing, testing, and maintaining the application. Apart from the high-class design and user interface, a good practice needs to be done to provide quality customer service.[11]
A typical shopping cart should contain certain features such as adding items to the cart and checking out those items using the available payment methods. Most shopping-cart applications are implemented using HTTP cookies or query strings, and an HTML setup is required to install the shopping cart on the servers that ultimately hosts the site on the internet. Most of these server-based applications require data related to the items added in the shopping cart to be kept in a session object which can be accessed later and manipulated dynamically because the users can add or remove one or more items from the cart. Most simple shopping-cart applications do not allow checkout to be done before any items are added to the cart. Data are often stored in an external database or application-based databases which can be accessed in real time by the application administrator.[12]
There are many examples of online shopping applications developed in different languages. Choosing a development platform and language depends on policies set by the company for which the application is being designed. It also depends on several other factors which are very important when considering the platform to design an application, for example, how portable the application will be after being built or if the application is open sourced. Java is chosen for this application because various reasons: it is a simple, robust, and cross-platform language. Applications written in Java can be transported and run on any environment, be it


MAC or Linux, because Java programs are compiled into platform-independent byte codes.[11] Because of the robustness of Java, it is a very safe language, as they provide exception handling and a layer method to communicate with the database, which prevents the system from crashing easily. Another very important factor from the development point of view is that the Java language is object oriented, where everything is treated as an object and where class methods are implemented instead of functions or procedures, which makes it very simple to understand the code.
Several Java shopping-cart applications were examined, and implementation details were compared with the proposed design for this application to build an even simpler architecture was developed which is very easy to understand from the learning perspective. Some online shopping applications are as follows:
·           SoftSlate Commerce[12]
 
·           Commerce4j[13]
 
·           Cs.Cart[14]
 
·           Apache Ofbiz[15]
 
These applications are designed for industrial purposes to generate revenue by providing these applications to customers looking to launch a website for their respective businesses.[17] The application proposed in this paper is more focused on developing a simple, yet complete, application specifically designed for computer science students to learn the basics about application design and development. This application performs all the basic functions that the above-mentioned applications do, such as selecting an item and adding it to the shopping cart, user login or registering, checkout of the item, etc. Other functions that can be added to this application are proposed in the future work, and they would be necessary under a more complete


and complex design. The final application is expected to teach students enough to start them on a course to implement more complex functionalities, as mentioned in the Future Work.
1.4.  Paper Organization
 
The rest of the document is divided into three parts: Objectives, Implementation, and Testing. The Objectives chapter lists the need for building the system. It provides use cases to help the business and technical users with their understanding. It also gives a detailed explanation for each use case to help with design and implementation, and outlines the constraints regarding the software. The Implementation chapter contains the detailed design of the system, including the Class Diagram, Activity Diagram, and Component Diagram. This chapter also includes a detailed explanation for each component as well as the interaction of the class and its components with each other when carrying out certain tasks, besides software’s mock screen shots.


CHAPTER 2. OBJECTIVES
 
All the steps required in the software-analysis process related to this project (product function, user characteristics, functional and nonfunctional requirements, constraints, assumptions, and dependencies for the online shopping cart application) are described in the following sections.
2.1.   Requirements Analysis
 
The requirements analysis and gathering processes are critical for the success of any software engineering project. Requirements analysis in software engineering is a process that determines the tasks that are required to determine the needs and conditions to design a new product or to make modifications in any existing product/application. This process considers all the stakeholders’ conflicting requirements, and analyzes the documentation and validation of the system. The requirements should be actionable, measurable, testable, and related to the defined needs of the system design. From the software-engineering perspective, requirements analysis is a three-step process.
1.      Requirements Elicitation: Elicitation of requirements, also known as requirements gathering, includes the task of identifying various requirement types from stakeholders or from project documentation.
2.      Requirements Analysis: Analysis of requirements determines if the gathered requirements are clear, complete, and consistent. The analysis also handles any ambiguous requirements that do not clearly state what needs to be implemented, which could create a loss of resources and time if identified later in the development or testing phase.
Requirement analysis requires identifying the stakeholders and taking their needs into account to help them understand the implications of designing the new system, along with


what modules are worth implementing and which ones are more cost efficient, and then to create a software-requirement specification document. To clearly elicit the stakeholders’ requirements, different processes, such as developing a scenario or user stories, and identifying the use case which is being used for the project, can be utilized.
Stakeholder analysis says that, to clearly gather the requirements of the project, analysts first need to identify the stakeholders. Stakeholders are people or organizations that have a valid interest or use in the system. The steps to identify the stakeholders are as follows:
·       Anyone who operates the system.
 
·       Anyone who benefits from the system
 
·       Anyone who is directly or indirectly involved in purchasing the system
 
·       People or organizations opposed to the system
 
·       Organizations responsible for the system design
 
·       Organizations that regulate the financial or safety aspects of the system
 
Once the stakeholders are successfully identified, interviews are conducted through different processes; the needs and requirements of the system are identified, and a requirements specification document is prepared. The document is then discussed with the major stakeholders to identify any ambiguity with the requirements and understanding of the system.
3.      Requirements Documentation: This step involves documenting the requirements in various forms, including summary lists, natural language documents, visual documents, use cases, user stories, or process specifications. A requirement specification document is categorized in different ways according to the stakeholders’ need, helping to create a clear contract between development and business. The following sections include the different


categories of requirements specification document that are essential for designing this application: the functional requirements, constraints, system requirements, etc.
2.1.1.   Product Perspective

CHAPTER 3. IMPLEMENTATION
 
This chapter includes the detailed design used to build the online shopping-cart application. The system's design is used to create the functions and operations of the gathered requirements in detail, including screen layouts, business rules, process diagrams, and other documentation. The output of this chapter describes the new system which is defined as a collection of modules and subsystems. This design stage takes the initial input requirements that were identified in the approved requirements specification document. For each requirement, there is a set of one or more design elements that are produced using the different prototypes.
These design elements describe the desired software features, in detail, including functional hierarchy diagrams, screen layouts, activity diagrams, and class diagrams. The intention of these diagrams is to describe the software in detail so that the system can develop the application with less additional design input. The system’s mock screen shots are shown later in this chapter.

3.1.1.  Activity Diagram
 
This section lists the activity diagram and describes the flow of activities in the system. A detailed description is then given after the figure for each activity. Figure 3 provides the overview of the activity of online shopping cart application.
The figure below demonstrates the activity flow for this online shopping-cart application. The flow of the application is similar for both the user and administrator. The flow begins when the user first runs the application home screen online shopping-cart application that appears in the web browser. The user can browse through the available list of categories and can choose either to select a category or to directly view the cart. In the category, a user can select view more information for details about a particular item before deciding to add it to the shopping cart by clicking on the cart icon next to the item. The user can then decide to either continue shopping by clicking the continue shopping button or can check out by clicking on the checkout option. If there are no items in the cart, then the user does not have an option to click checkout. The user can check out after doing the user authentication by logging in with the username and password. Once the user successfully logins/registers, the order form, where the user can put the correct information to place the order appears. If the user includes incorrect or incomplete




	

	

	

	

information, then placing the order is not allowed. After the user successfully inputs the correct information, placing order is successful, and the user can see the success message. The additional flow step for the administrators is that they can view the user’s information, the user’s checkout, and the product details by using the database after the user successfully places an order.
3.1.1.         Class Diagram
 
1.      User Authentication: This class is utilized to get user information from the database and is for authenticating the users. The class diagram in Figure 4 shows the methods that are used in this class and the description of each class is listed below.
Authenticate User: This message is used to authenticate a particular user who has provided the login credentials and wishes to login in the system. This method checks the credentials in the database.
Check User Name: This method checks to see if the provided username already exists in the database. If there is an existing user with the same name, then the user is prompted to select another username to create an account.
Register User: This method allows a new user to register for an online shopping-cart account by entering a valid username and password. If the username already exists in database, the user will be prompted to choose another name.
Login User: This method allows the existing users to log in to the database with the credentials they used for first registering into the application.
2.      DB Controller: This class is used for getting users and product information from the database, and it is also used to update the database with the information about new-user registration, product checkout, and user details.
Initialize DB: This method allows the initialization of a database on the first run of the application.
Retrieve Items List: This method fetches all items from the code/workspace into the database and allows the administrator to view information about the items.


Retrieve Category List: This method retrieves the list of all categories that are available for the shopping-cart application.
Retrieve User’s Details: This role locates all the registered users in the database and also fetches any new user who registers by completing the user-authentication form.
Get Order Details: This role updates the row in the database with the details of the user who checks out the items and successfully places an order.
Get Ordered Product Details: This role inputs the details of the order once the items are checked out and the order is successfully placed. This role updates the row in the database to show the details of products that have been checked out.
3.          Place Order: This class is used to process all information regarding the order of products.
 
Get Checkout Information: This method provides information about items in the shopping cart once the checkout method is called. This will further invoke the user-authentication method.
Get User Authentication: This method fetches the user-authentication information. The place-order class is invoked once all three methods are successfully called. If the user authentication fails, the place-order class is not executed.
Retrieve Order Form Information: This method is executed once user authentication is a success. This method evaluates an order form on the UI for dynamic input from the user. If any of the information is incomplete or is invalid, then an error message is depicted, and the place-order class is not called.
4.      Cart: This class invokes the shopping cart. This class can be called in cases when no items are added to the cart, when items are already there in the cart, or when the user adds an item to the cart.


Get Items: This method retrieves information for all the items that the user adds to the shopping cart.
5.      Checkout: This class invokes the checkout button. The checkout class is only called when there are items in the shopping cart. In the case of an empty shopping cart, the checkout class is not called, thus no checkout option is available on user-interface screen.
Retrieve Cart Info: This method retrieves the shopping cart’s information if there are items in the cart, and then, the checkout class is called.
Get Items: This method gets all the items in the shopping cart. If the count of items in shopping cart is greater than 0, then this function updates the card information, indicating that cart is not empty which then calls the checkout class.
3.1.           The Shopping Cart Application Implementation
 
This section contains the implementation details for different packages and classes of the shopping-cart application. It also contains the coding snippets that help computer science


students understand what a particular section of code represents. The following steps are required to run the application successfully:
1.          Install the Eclipse IDE and Apache Tomcat
 
2.          Configure the tomcat server, and import the project file into Eclipse IDE
In the package explorer, expand the database package, and run DbController.java as a Java application.
Once the JDBC connection is established using the database, run the default.xhtml class from the web-content package that initiates the tomcat server and runs the application locally


Default.xhtml is a client-side implementation and is responsible for displaying the application’s default main page. The code is implemented in HTML and JavaScript which calls into the Master.XHTML which contains the template for the user-interface display. The coding snippet in Figure 7 shows the setup of the main default page that contains the application title and calls the display-category page.
shopping-session bean represents server-side implementation of this online shopping-cart application. This bean's client can add or remove an item or can retrieve information from the database. All session beans require a session model that maps the item ID with the one described in the database. The business interface for this online shopping-cart application is a fairly plain Java interface that defines all the business logic implemented in the session-model class. The primary purpose of this session model is to run business tasks for the stakeholders. The snippet in Figure 8 describes the session model used in the application code which is being mapped to the controller- and server-side functions for calculating the sales tax and validating the form information.
3.1.  The Shopping Cart Application Interface
 
This section describes the different interfaces for the online shopping-cart application. It contains a detailed description about each interface along with a screen shot of the interface.
1.      Home Page: The home page of the application (Figure 9) is common to all the system users/administrators. This interface is available through the web application. At the time of logging into the home page, the page shows the categories available for shopping. By default, there are six categories:
a.      Electronics
b.     Clothing
c.      Jewelry
d.     Shoes
e.      Furniture
 Entertainment
1.      Items Interface: This interface links all categories to an individual page that contains items related to a particular category. Inside each category page, there are items which can be browsed and added to the shopping cart. There is a button/link back to the home page that would return the user to the application’s main page, showing the categories, and a user can then choose to browse another category or directly view the cart to check out. There are six
categories on the main page, and each category contains six items in the user interface that


are similar to the main page. A similar page structure is used for both the home page and the items page. There is a separate page for each category’s items; the pages are joined using Java-server facets. The design and colors for the user interface are implemented by CSS and HTML tags embedded in JavaScript. The screenshots demonstrate items on each page of the category. The size of each image on the items page is a thumbnail (70 x 70 pixels). The size of an image on the description page is fuller (150 x 150 pixels).
2.      Electronics Category Item Interface: The screenshot below shows items in the electronics category. There are six items listed individually with a price. There is also a “more” button that allows users to obtain additional information about the item. The little shopping cart icon next to “more” link adds the items to the shopping cart.
Clothing Category Item Interface: Figure 11 is the screenshot of the clothing category that displays six clothing items.
a.          Jewelry Category Interface: Figure 12 is the screenshot of the jewelry category that displays six jewelry items.
Shoes Category Interface: Figure 13 is the screenshot of the shoes category that displays six shoe items
d.        Furniture Category Interface: Figure 14 is the screenshot of the furniture category that displays six furniture items.








 
e.        Entertainment Category Interface: Figure 15 is the screenshot of the entertainment category and displays six entertainment items.








4.        View Cart Interface: In the view-cart interface, both users and the administrator can access items that were added to the cart (Figure 16). They can also access to view the empty cart. Inside the cart interface, the user/administrator has the option to update the cart by either deleting items from list of selected items or by adding items to the list by clicking the continue shopping button. Both the user and administrator also have the option to check out items in the cart by clicking the checkout button which takes them to the order-form page interface. 


Figure 17 displays the screenshot of the shopping cart after deleting the item from the cart. Once a user deletes an item from the cart, the cart updates/refreshes itself with the newer number of items in the view-cart interface.
 
Figure 18 displays the screenshot of the shopping cart after adding the item. The user can view the updated shopping cart when any item is added to the cart by using the shopping-cart icon. 
5.        Checkout Interface: The checkout button is visible to the user only when there are items in the shopping cart. If there are no items in the shopping cart, the checkout button disappears (Figure 19). If there is at least one item in the shopping cart, then the checkout button is visible to the user, and the user can check out.






6.        Login Interface: The user has to login/register to the user-authentication form by utilizing the username and password once the checkout button is clicked to place an order. The login interface appears when the user clicks the checkout button (Figure 20) 
Figure 21 displays that, if the user enters invalid information in username and password fields, an error message appears on the top right of the screen, displaying invalid credentials. The error message in the gray box pops up when the user tries to login/register with invalid information and disappears after a 


Figure 22 shows that, if the user enters incomplete information in the username and password fields, an error message appears next to the column, indicating that a value is required. The error message next to the column appears in the red text and stays there until the user does not provide the correct information.
7.        Order Form Interface: The order-form page (Figure 23) consists of a form where the user/administrator completes the personal information, such as name, email address, shipping address, and phone number, to check out. After filling in the information, the user places the order by clicking on the place button, bringing him to a final message page indicating that the order was successfully placed.
Place Order: This interface notifies the user/administrator that the order was successfully placed after the user has submitted the shipping information. The user cannot place an order if the information is invalid or incomplete (Figure 24).


Figure 25 displays the successful order-confirmation message that “your order has been placed successfully.”


8.        Database Interface: Using this, the administrator can access information for all users who have placed order of the items in access database table which is automatically updated when the place-order button is clicked. Figure 26 displays the database with the users’ tab that contains the information for all the users that authorizes their information using the user- authentication form. After clicking the refresh button on the users’ tab once a new user successfully registers, that user’s information is updated on the first row in the database table.
 
Figure 27 shows the categories tab which currently displays all six categories used in the shopping-cart application. If the administrator is to add/update categories for the application, then refreshing the page would also update the number of categories.
 
Items from different categories can be identified by their ID and Category_ID. This product table also lists the total number of items in stock, the price, the name, and the description of each item


Figure 29 displays the order information, including all the user information that was completed in the order form before the final order was placed. Right now, the database is empty, implying that no user has placed an order.
Figure 30 displays informaiton about the user once the order is successfully placed. All the columns are automatically updated with the appropriate informaton that was used on the order form in appropriate columns.


 
 
Figure 31 displays the ordered-products table in the database that contains information about all the ordered products. This table displays all items that have been successfully checked out. For example, in this screenshot, the user has ordered 1 item from the clothing category with a price of $45 and another item from the jewelry category with a price of $250. Similarly, if more successful orders are placed, then this table is updated, and the administrator can view the updated table by refreshing it.


 
 


CHAPTER 4. TESTING
 
This chapter includes the methods that were used for testing, validating, and evaluating the system. The Conclusion and the Future Work for the software are also given.
4.1.  Methodology
 
With this testing approach, all the specs were ready for a prototype, and a plan was already built to be shown; the tester started writing his or her code and saw if he or she could obtain the same results that the specs mentioned. This way, the specs were tested on each prototype, and continuous testing was applied. This also helped to minimize the testing that would have to be implemented at the end of the software lifecycle. In the process, all aspects of the software were tested. Steps to follow while implementing the methodology are as follows:
1.          Start with a base function that you want to implement.
 
2.      Create a document with the detailed requirement definition, an activity diagram with a description of the flow, database tables to be used, a component diagram, and a description of each component with the precondition and tables that would be affected by the component.
3.      Give the document to the tester, and work with the tester while he or she writes the code to check if the steps in the document can be implemented and if the result of each use case can be achieved.
4.      If the tester finds a step difficult to implement or thinks he or she is missing additional information to implement the functionality, then go to step 2; otherwise, go to step 3.
5.      Ask the tester to log on all the errors and difficulties he or she encountered while working on the prototype implementation.
6.      Once the prototype is done and the results between the developer’s prototype and tester’s
 
prototype match, work on the other requirement, and expand the prototype to final software.


7.      When the testing approach was implemented, the following pros and cons regarding the testing approach were realized.
Pros of using the methodology
 
·       Helps give a better understanding about the requirements.
 
·       Better design at the end of the cycle.
 
·       Reduced testing to be performed at the end of the cycle
 
·       Documents produced would be of higher quality.
 
Cons of using the methodology
 
·       The person working on the document should be experienced.
 
·       There are increased time and money involved with testing.
 
·       Different viewpoints for the same problem can lead to varying results.
 
4.2.  Interface Testing
 
This section lists the functional requirements used for creating the test-case table, the test cases that were used to verify the interface table, and the results for the test-cases table.
Table 1 lists the functional requirements for the interface built for the online shopping- cart application, along with a short description of each requirement


The online shopping-cart application shall have two types of authentication: User authentication and Admin authentication. The online shopping-cart application shall be accessible to all the users to browse all the categories and the items. The users shall be able to view the items they added to the shopping cart. The Admin shall be able to upload new/revised items as well as to add/modify the categories. The Admin shall be able to view all the users registered in the system. The Admin shall be able to view all the information about users who placed an order from the shopping cart. The users shall not be able to check out with an empty cart. The users shall not be able to place an order without providing valid information for all rows in the order form. The users shall not be able to place an order if any of the columns in the order form are left empty.

CHAPTER 5. CONCLUSION/FUTURE WORK
 
This chapter includes the Conclusion reached after creating the current version of the software to meet the system objectives. The comparison is done between the system that was built and original requirements that were designed at the beginning of the project. It also describes the Future Work that is intended to be accomplished with later versions of the software.
5.1.  Conclusion
 
The main objective of the application is to help computer science students understand the basics of Java, JavaScript, and HTML. By browsing through the application and looking at the code for each graphical interpretation, students should be able to easily understand the implementation. The following results have been achieved after the completing the system and relate back to the system’s objective.
1.      Should allow computer science students to browse through the code and application: This is achieved when users, i.e., computer science students, are able to run and install the application. When they run the application, they can browse through the implementation of different objects.
2.      Should allow users to browse through different product categories: This is achieved when the user first runs the application and is directed to a home page that has categories available for all the different item types that can be purchased with this online shopping-cart application. The user can browse and click on any category to view the items listed for that particular category.
3.      Should allow users to save items to the cart and also to view detailed information about a particular item: The users can add any number of items to the shopping cart from any of


the listed categories by simply clicking the cart icon at the right-hand corner of each item. Users can view a detailed description of the item and price by clicking on the more icon next to the cart icon.
4.      Should allow users to check out the items: This is achieved when users click the checkout button in the shopping cart. The checkout button disappears when there are no items in the shopping cart. This implies that users can only click the checkout button when there are items in the shopping cart.
5.      System users should be able to place the order by filling out the order form: This is achieved when a user clicks the checkout button and an order form appears on the same page, showing the detailed order total with shipping charges and sales tax, which requires the user to complete all the information to successfully place an order. The user is not able to place an order if any information on the form is invalid or empty.
6.      The user should see a success message after placing an order: This is achieved when a user successfully places an order by completely filling in all the rows after which he or she can click the place-order button. The user receives a message that the order has been successfully placed.
5.2.  Future Work
 
The following section discusses the work that will be implemented with future releases of the software.
1.      Detailed categories: Future work could involve adding more categories which are more detailed and have additional items.
2.      Watch/Wish List: Work can add a watch list or wish list so that users can add an item to a list to watch for item prices to go down or to see when there is a sale on any of those items.


3.      Enhanced User Interface: Work on enhancing the user interface by adding more user- interactive features.
4.      Recommended Items: Add a bar that would display the most-recommended items which would depend on the number of times an item has been purchased by any users.
5.      Payment Options: Add different payment options, such as Visa, MasterCard, PayPal, etc., where a user can also save the card information for later checkouts.
6.      Shipping Options: Add different types of shipping options: regular shipping, expedited shipping, international shipping, etc.
7.          Recent History: Display the user’s recently browsed items in the recent-history tab.


 Introduction The Software Requirements Specification is designed to document and describe the agreement between the customer and the developer regarding the specification of the software product requested [5]. Its primary purpose is to provide a clear and descriptive “statement of user requirements” [5] that can be used as a reference in further development of the software system. This document is broken into a number of sections used to logically separate the software requirements into easily referenced parts. This Software Requirements Specification aims to describe the Functionality, External Interfaces, Attributes and Design Constraints [4] imposed on Implementation of the software system described throughout the rest of the document. Throughout the description of the software system, the language and terminology used should unambiguous and consistent throughout the document. 1.1 Purpose Defining and describing the functions and specifications of the Book E-Commerce System (BECS) is the primary goal of this Software Requirements Specification (SRS). This Software Requirements Specification illustrates, in clear terms, the system’s primary uses and required functionality as specified by our customer. The intended audience of this document is our primary Book E-Commerce System customer: Mr. Borzoo Bonakdarpour, the CSE435 instructor Dr. Betty Cheng, the fall semester 2007 CSE435 Group 4 members, as well as the other students attending CSE435 that will require access to such documentation.
Scope The software system being produced is called Book E-Commerce System or BECS. It is being produced for a customer interested in selling books via the Internet. This system is designed to “provide automation support” [2] for the process of placing books for sale on the Internet and facilitating the actual sale. This system is largely cross-platform and is available to anyone using the Computer Science Department’s provided computer resources in the MSU Engineering Building. The system will be run on a central server with each user having a remote user interface through a web browser to interact with it. The Book E-Commerce System will allow any user to create an account to become a customer. The customer, through the process of account creation, will have the option to become a member of the site. The system will allow customers to browse, search, select, and add books to a shopping cart. Then, provided they have books in their shopping cart, check out books in shopping cart and decrement the stock that the inventory the system maintains. The BECS also allows a manager to manage the inventory with full create, retrieve, update and delete (CRUD) functionality with regards to books in the system. It will also allow, on an inventory wide basis, customers and managers to interact with a promotion system that handles percentage-off promotions that can be applied to member’s orders. This interaction includes the creation (by managers) and the application to orders (by customers) of the promotions. The BECS has full email capabilities; the automated email functionality will be used to send promotions to members of the system as well as provide the managers with low-stock notifications. The BECS will have numerous constraints on what it can do. The system will not have full credit-card processing capabilities. It will not allow managers to be customers. The manager will be a hard-coded user and only a single manager will exist. There will be no actual book ordering and order completion, however the system will provide the customer with a receipt and it will log the transaction details. The system will not allow multiple promotions to be added to a single shopping cart nor will it allow a customer to add more than one of each item to their cart. The system also will not allow users to retrieve passwords or edit their user details. 
BECS Book E-Commerce System Barcode A unique identifier assigned to single items Book An instance of an Item that has these additional attributes: Title, Author Button A user interface element that allows a User to click and inform the system to take an action Checkbox A user interface element that allows a User to inform the system that he/she selected a particular item Checkout The process a Customer goes through to purchase an Item CRUD Create, Retrieve, Update, Delete Customer A person that is a user of the system but has created an account Inventory An object that holds items available for purchase by the Customer Item An individual entity in the inventory which has several descriptive attributes: Barcode, Price, Reorder Threshold, Stock Manager A single person that has the ability to create, retrieve, update and delete items in the store. This person cannot simultaneously act as a Customer and Manager. Member A person that is a customer of the system and has requested to be sent promotions Promotion An item-wide percentage-off price discount applied to a Member's shopping cart Reorder The system process that automatically orders new stock of an item Reorder Threshold The numeric value of an item's stock that must be reached before the system will order additional quantities of the item Session The time which a User is actively using the system Shopping Cart An object that lists a Customer's selected Items, their applied promotions and gives them an option to check out SRS Software Requirements Specification Stock The quantity of any particular item the inventory has on hand Text Box A user interface element that allows a User to input text to the system Transaction The information related to a customer's purchase that is logged User The person who operate the software product.
This Software Requirements Specification document is divided into multiple subsections. The first section includes explanations of the Purpose, Scope and Organization of the document. The first section also handles the description of project specific words, acronyms and abbreviations that will be used in the document. The second section of the document is separated into the following five different sections, each detailing specific details of system uses and their corresponding actions: Product Perspective, Product Functions, User Characteristics, Constraints, Assumptions and Dependencies, Apportioning of Requirements. The third section is an enumerated listing of all of the requirements described for this system. The fourth section encompasses all of the Use-case, Sequence, State and Class diagrams that model the system. In the fifth section there exists a Prototype of the system along with a sample scenario that graphically describes the use of the system. The sixth section contains a listing of all related reference materials used in this document. The seventh and final subsection is dedicated to providing a point of contact for any viewer of this document. This section includes details about what is and is not expected of the BECS system in addition to which cases are intentionally unsupported and assumptions that will be used in the creation of the BECS system.
BECS is an online bookstore website which supports a number of functions for both the consumer and store's management. The website must be available to anyone using the Computer Science Department’s provided computer resources in the MSU Engineering Building and as such must work correctly in both Internet Explorer and Mozilla Firefox. As stated by the customer, there are no hardware or software requirements beyond these including, but not limited to, memory or specific software packages that need to be utilized nor software packages that need not be utilized.
BECS will provide a number of functions; each is listed below. • Maintain data associated with the inventory (a collection of books) • A book has a title, author and price • The inventory also keep track of the stock/quantity of each book • Maintain records for many customers • A customer can be either a member or non-member. • A customer has a username (unique across all users), password (no restrictions), email address (no restrictions), and postal address (unverified.) • Anyone may sign up for a customer account. • Allow any customer to become a member. • Show a listing of available books • Books are to be displayed in ascending alphabetical order by title. • Each book will list the following from left to right • Title • Author • Price • Allow customers and managers to log in and out of the system. • Users (both customers and the manager) will be logged out if inactive for 30 minutes. • Shopping cart • Anyone is able to add one or more books to the shopping cart. • The shopping cart does not need to allow multiple copies of any book. Checkout • Checkout is only available to logged-in customers. A user that is not logged in as a customer is given a chance to log in. • Member customers may enter a promotion code. • Only one promotion code may be used per purchase • The promotion is a fixed percentage discount that is to be applied to an entire order. • The discount is specified by the manager at the time of the promotion’s creation or most recent update/edit. • Collect a 16-digit credit card number from the customer • Log/record the transaction • Allow manager to specify a stop-order for a book • Each book has its own stop-order status – either on or off. Details of its use are involved in the following feature. • Notify manager when books need to be reordered • When the quantity a book falls below a threshold, the manager is notified that the book needs to be reordered.
• One exception is if the manager has already specified a stop-order for this book. • Every book must either have stop-order enabled or disabled • Allow manager to update stock quantities • Allow manager to change any book's price • Allow manager to view transaction logs • Allow manager to create promotions • A promotion is a percentage discount that can be applied to an entire order • Promotions may only be used by member customers • A promotion has an expiration date specified by the manager When a promotion is created, it is emailed to all member customers via the email address on record
The typical BECS user is simply anyone that has access to the Internet and a web browser in the computer science department at Michigan State University. It is assumed that the user is familiar enough with a computer to operate the browser, keyboard and mouse and is capable of browsing to, from and within simple websites
As stated by the customer, security is not a concern for this system. The database may store passwords in plain text and there doesn't need to be a password recovery feature nor lockout after numerous invalid login attempts. As such, the system may not work correctly in cases when security is a concern. These cases include those listed above in addition to lack of an encrypted connection when sending credit card information and forcing users to use “strong” passwords. A strong password is a password that meets a number of conditions that are set in place so that user's passwords cannot be easily guessed by an attacker. Generally, these rules include ensuring that the password contains a sufficient number of characters and contains not only lowercase letters but also capitals, numbers, and in some cases, symbols. The system may not behave correctly when used with Internet browsers other than Firefox and Internet Explorer.
SCR "Software Cost Reduction (SCR) is a set of techniques for designing software systems developed by David Parnas and researchers from the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory beginning in the late 1970s." [7] Mode Class "A mode class is a finite state machine, with states called system modes" [8] System State The current state or mode that the system is in. The system must be in exactly one state at any moment in time. Event An event is any action that can trigger an action within the software system. Examples include but are not limited to changing values of variables or user-triggered events. Controlled Variable A variable whose value can change throughout the lifetime of the system and whose value is critical and must be maintained correctly. Mode Transition When the mode (state) changes from one mode (described as the old mode) to a new mode. Mode Class Table Table consisting of a list of modes that the system can be in, modes that can be transitioned to, and the conditions required for the transition to occur. The table if formatted such that the first column lists the current mode (old mode) and the last column lists the new mode. The columns between the first and last columns each describe a specific event. Event Table An event table illustrates how an input event can affect a controlled variable. The first column shows modes and the last row shows the values that the controlled variable will be set to. The remaining cells are conditions required for a mode to affect the value of a controlled variable. Condition Table A condition table shows the conditions (one of which must be met) in order for a controlled variable to be set to some specified value. The first column lists modes and the last row names the controlled variable and the values it is set to.
Client: We have assumed that all of the computer systems in the Engineering building labs are in proper working condition and that the user is capable of operating these system's basic functions including but not limited to being able to power on the system, login and open either Internet Explorer or Mozilla Firefox, and navigate the browser to the address of this BECS website. Provider: We have assumed that the BECS will be running on a properly working web server and database system with an Internet connection that allows this system to perform all communications with clients. Assumptions: • There is no need for anyone to be able to order more than a single copy of a book (or any item) in a single transaction. • The manager account’s username and password maybe hard coded. • The manager cannot be a customer. • Any user cannot edit their account information
As stated by the customer, security is not a concern of this project. As such, it is beyond the scope of this system to encrypt personal user data, encrypt credit card information, prevent unauthorized login attempts, or any other concern of this nature. Additionally, the system is not responsible for the following: • Verifying that credit card information is valid Template based on IEEE Std 830-1998 for SRS. Modifications (content and ordering of information) have been made by Betty H.C. Cheng, Michigan State University (chengb at chengb.cse.msu.edu) • Verifying the email address provided by a user • Storing additional information about a book beyond simply the title, name of author, and price • Allowing users to edit their account details (username, password, mailing address, etc) • Allowing customers to order multiple copies of a book in a single order • Providing individual product pages (one page for every item in the inventory) • Allowing the manager to update login credentials or other information about the manager Additionally, the system may need to later be extended to provide additional functions. One such example is added support for visually impaired users. In many cases a screenreading program is used and ensuring that page-layout reads from top-left to bottom-right in a logical manner would be required.

2. Overall Description 2.1 Product Perspective Robo shop is aimed towards the vendors who want to reach out to the maximum cross-section of customer and common people who can be potential customer. This project envisages bridging the gap between the seller, the retailer and the customer. OFS should be user-friendly, ‘quick to learn’ and reliable software for the above purpose. OFS is intended to be a stand-alone product and should not depend on the availability of other software. It should run on both UNIX and Windows based platform.
2.2 Product Functions ➢ The main purpose of this project is to reduce the manual work. ➢ Functions: A Customer can browse through the shops and choose products to place in a virtual shopping cart. The shopping cart details can be viewed and items can be removed from the cart. To proceed with the purchase, the customer is prompted to login. Also, the customer can modify personal profile information (such as phone number and shipping address) stored by the application. The customer can also view the status of any previous orders, and cancel any order that has not been shipped yet. 2.3 User Classes and Characteristics ➢ The user should be familiar with the Shopping Mall related terminology like Shopping cart/Checking out/Transaction etc. ➢ The user should be familiar with the Internet.
2.4 Operating Environment The product will be operating in windows environment. Roob shop system is a website and shall operate in all famous browsers, for a model we are talking Microsoft Internet Explorer, Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox. Also it will be compatible with the IE 6.0. Most of the features will be compatible with the Mozilla Firefox and Opera 7.0 or higher version. The only requirement to use this online product would be the internet connection. The hardware configuration include Hard Disk: 40GB, Monitor: 15 inch Color monitor, Keyboard: 122 keys. The basic input devices required are keyboard, mouse and output devices are monitor etc 2.5 Design and Implementation Constraints An online store is a virtual store on the Internet where customers can browse the catalog and select products of interest. The selected items may be collected in a shopping cart. At checkout time, the items in the shopping cart will be presented as an order. At that time, more information will be needed to complete the transaction. Usually, the customer will be asked to fill or select a billing address, a shipping address, a shipping option, and payment information such as credit card number. An e-mail notification is sent to the customer as soon as the order is placed 2.6 User Documentation The product will include user manual. The user manual will include product overview, complete configuration of the used software (such as SQL server), technical details, backup procedure and contact information which will include email address. There will be no online help for the product at this moment. The product will be compatible with the Internet Explorer 6.0 or higher. The databases will be created in the MySQL.
