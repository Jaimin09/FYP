Links that provide communications between the TCS and other systems shall be secured in a manner appropriate for the sensitivities of the material passed through such links.
The TCS shall be designed to protect its communication and data links against enemy Electronic Warfare (EW) threats, physical anti-radiation weaponry and physical destruction. 
All hardware, software, documentation, and sensitive information processed by TCS shall be physically protected, minimally at the level determined by the risk index computed in Section 381.
The TCS shall be approved for operation at the same level as the systems with which it interfaces. 
All TCS users, operators, maintainers and other personnel having access to TCS shall be cleared to the highest sensitivity of the data that the TCS processes, stores and transfers. 
Additional local site procedures shall be developed to prevent the intentional or unintentional disclosure of sensitive information to unauthorized individuals. 
A training program consisting of an initial security training and awareness briefing covering AIS security in general but also tailored to the TCS shall be developed.
